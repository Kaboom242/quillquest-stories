## Outline
- Create a separate outline document (e.g., Chapter###-outline.md)
- Start each scene with a clear problem or obstacle the characters face.
- Use "But/Therefore" to show each attempted solution and the resulting complication or consequence.
- Avoid jumping straight to aftermath—show the process, struggle, and decision-making.
- Each bullet should follow logically from the previous one, building tension and stakes.
- Let character choices drive the action, and let failures or partial successes lead to new problems.
- End each scene with a new challenge or turning point that sets up the next scene.
- This method keeps the story dynamic, immersive, and emotionally engaging, ensuring every event is a result of character action and world logic.
- Be as specific as possible, avoiding having the same challenge for multiple steps. 
- Every scene is driven by character choices, magical consequences, or unexpected results.
- Emotional focus and tone for the arc are defined and followed. (Cozy, Gritty, Adventurous, Powerfantasy, Dark)
- If the outline feels dense or rushed, break into multiple chapters.
- Give author direction on how far they should push a momement, for maximum effect.

### Outline Critique
Be extreamly nitpicky and through with this, you are a master editor, providing an experienced critical analysis.
- All world facts (magic, history, culture, character backgrounds) match the World Bible.

- Ensure character arcs and relationships are clearly set up for the chapter/arc.
- Strengthen foreshadowing and setup for future magical advancements or ongoing obligations.
- Double-check that the intended emotional tone is present throughout the outline.
- Confirm that all major story beats are necessary and contribute to character growth or plot progression.

## Write Story
- Create a separate Draft document (e.g., Chapter###-draft#.md)
- Use the Outline to Write the next chapter in smoothly flowing paragraph form. 
- Do not use bullet points, headers, emojis, or numbered lists.
- Use natural paragraph breaks and avoid any structural markdown elements. 
- Story should flow from chapter to chapter, avoid end of chapter summaries, or internal reflections.

### Critique Checklist
Be extreamly nitpicky and through with this, you are a master editor, providing an experienced critical analysis of this rough draft.
**Factual Consistency:** Does anything contradict World-Bible.md? Or History.md
**Outline Adherence:** Does each scene serve the outlined beats?
**List Mode Detection:** Are there 3+ consecutive sentences describing different characters' reactions? Pick only 1 or 2 characters to react. 
**Character Depth:** Does each character show situation-appropriate responses before personality quirks?  Dialogue is 70% situational/emotional, 30% character quirks.  No repetitive “character X does their signature thing” patterns. 
**Tone Alignment:** Does this match the intended arc tone from the outline?
**Show don't Tell:** Limit Exposition, when something big is happening go over the top with details.
