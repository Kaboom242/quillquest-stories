## Outline
- Create a separate outline document (e.g., Chapter###-outline.md)
- Start each scene with a clear problem or obstacle the characters face.
- Make a natural, mystery-driven progression (one unfolding problem -> investigations -> solution).
- Each scene starts with a clear Problem.
- Use "But/Therefore" to show each attempted solution and the resulting complication or consequence.
- Avoid jumping straight to aftermath—show the process, struggle, and decision-making.
- Each bullet should follow logically from the previous one, building tension and stakes.
- Let character choices drive the action, and let failures or partial successes lead to new problems.
- End each scene with a new challenge or turning point that sets up the next scene.
- This method keeps the story dynamic, immersive, and emotionally engaging, ensuring every event is a result of character action and world logic.
- Be as specific as possible, avoiding having the same challenge for multiple steps. 
- Every scene is driven by character choices, magical consequences, or unexpected results.
- Emotional focus and tone for the arc are defined and followed. (Cozy, Gritty, Adventurous, Powerfantasy, Dark)
- If the outline feels dense or rushed, break into multiple chapters.
- Give author direction on how far they should push a momement, for maximum effect.

## Write Story
- Create a separate Draft document (e.g., Chapter###-draft#.md)
- Write the next chapter in smoothly flowing paragraph form. 
- Do not use bullet points, headers, emojis, or numbered lists.
- Use natural paragraph breaks and avoid any structural markdown elements. 
- Story should flow from chapter to chapter, avoid end of chapter summaries, or internal reflections.

### Critique Checklist
Be extreamly nitpicky and preform a master level Critique, be brutally honest, providing an experienced critical analysis of this rough draft.
**Factual Consistency:** Does anything contradict World-Bible.md? Or History.md 
**Immersion:** POV anchor: Who sees, hears, smells in this paragraph? (limit to 1–2 characters)
**List Mode Detection:** Are there 3+ consecutive sentences describing different characters' reactions? Pick only 1 or 2 characters to react. 
**Character Depth:** Does it match the Narrative-bible?
**Show don't Tell:** Limit Exposition, when something big is happening go over the top with details. Ask “how would a reader experience this?” Convert to sensory detail.
**Pacing & Immersion:** Does each scene linger long enough for the reader to experience events in real time, with vivid sensory detail and emotional presence? Avoid summarizing or rushing through moments—let the reader see, hear, and feel the action as it unfolds, rather than being told what happened after the fact.
**Resolutions:** Did we resolve the initial problem the chapter was intented to be about? Are we setting up the next chapter, an not leaving any gaps?
