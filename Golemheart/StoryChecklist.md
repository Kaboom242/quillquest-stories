## Arc Planning & Design

### Plan out Arc
- Create a separate arc document (use `Arcs/Arc##-draft.md`). Start every arc with a 4-line Arc Contract: Theme • Setting • Stakes • Arc Goal (what success looks like).
- Add an Arc Contract section listing Inputs, Outputs, Success Criteria, and Hard Constraints (what cannot change).
- Recommended length: 6–20 chapters per arc (8–12 preferred for tight pacing).

- Chapter Requirements (MANDATORY — used by the critique loop):
  - Plot Beats (2–5 bullets): the core events of this chapter in sequence.
  - Prev → Target: one-line emotional anchor showing measurable character change.
  - Progression Note: concrete change (new ability name, revelation, wound, lost resource, ally gained).
  - Location Anchor: one-line place description and weather / Season.
  - Supporting-Cast Beat: one micro-POV line for at least one non-protagonist to preserve series dynamics.
  - Failure Check: list one credible thing that can go wrong here and its immediate consequence.

- Each chapter must serve the arc's central theme and introduce at least one distinct new element (ability, cultural detail, political complication, or location). If it introduces nothing new, merge or rewrite the chapter.

### Chapter template (copy into arc file for each chapter)
```markdown
Chapter ## — Title
- Plot Beats: 1) ... 2) ... (2–5 bullets)
- Prev → Target: [Character] Prev: ___ → Target: ___
- Progression Note: (e.g., learns "Memory Runes"; loses heirloom; gains an ally)
- Location: [Place], sensory anchor: (smell/sound/sight)
- Supporting-Cast Beat: (1-line micro-POV for Greta/Tobi/Willi/other)
- Failure Check: Credible failure + immediate consequence
```

Use this template in every arc planning file to make critique and revision-loop enforcement consistent and fast.

#### Arc Structure Critique
Be extremely thorough - analyze the arc as a cohesive whole before diving into individual chapters.
**Thematic Coherence:** Does the arc have a single, clear central theme that every chapter serves? Are subthemes properly integrated rather than competing? Does the arc's resolution feel earned by the journey?
**Character Arc Mapping:** For each main character, trace their emotional/skill progression from arc beginning to end. Are there clear growth milestones? Do characters build on previous development rather than resetting? Are internal conflicts escalating rather than repeating?
**Setting Progression:** Does the arc feel like movement through a real, interconnected space? Are locations distinct and purposeful? Does geography serve story needs (isolation, resources, cultural differences)?
**Knowledge/Ability Progression:** For magical/skill advancement arcs, does each chapter teach something genuinely new? Are abilities building toward a logical mastery synthesis? Is power progression earned through struggle rather than given freely?
**Stakes Escalation:** Do consequences and risks increase throughout the arc? Are later chapters forcing harder choices than earlier ones? Does the arc climax feel like the highest stakes moment?
**Revelation Distribution:** Are major reveals spread throughout the arc rather than front-loaded? Does each revelation change character understanding/goals rather than confirming existing knowledge? Are plot twists supported by proper foreshadowing?
**Failure, Lasting Consequences & Tonal Beats:**

- Failure and Lasting Consequences:
  - For every major success, list one credible failure that could plausibly have happened instead. Document immediate cost (physical, social, political) and a lasting consequence that alters goals or relationships.
  - Requirement: Each arc must contain at least two failures with irreversible consequences (loss, injury, exile, public scandal, or political fallout).

- Combat Encounters:
  - Are fights narratively necessary (stakes, character tests, worldbuilding)? For each encounter note: opponent, stakes (what is lost on failure), choreography anchors (who acts when), and immediate aftermath (wounded, resources spent, reputation change).
  - Avoid "combat for spectacle"—every battle should change the party or the world state.

- Power Fantasy:
  - Identify 1–3 earned moments where the protagonist can "shine." Each must have setup, cost, and meaningful consequence. Record the required prep (skill, tool, sacrifice) and a follow-up scene showing consequences or growth.
  - Include at least one scene where using power has moral or practical cost to prevent invulnerability fantasies.

- Cozy Vibes:
  - Schedule at least one true respite per arc (meals, campfires, festivals). These scenes should deepen bonds, reveal private stakes, or set up future conflict through contrast.
  - Use a sensory anchor (taste, smell, sound) and keep cozy scenes short but emotionally valuable.

- Comedic Fun:
  - Place levity where it supports character voice or tension release. Ensure jokes arise from character dynamics and do not undercut serious stakes.
  - If humor reduces tension too often, tighten placement or make it bittersweet (humor with cost).

- Quick checks for each beat:
  - If omitted: what reader need or pacing problem appears?
  - If overused: what tonal flattening or diminished stakes occur?
  - Tie each beat to Arc Theme: note in one sentence how the beat serves the central theme.


#### Arc Revision Guidelines
**Thematic Fixes:** If theme is unclear, identify the central question/conflict and ensure every chapter explores a different aspect. Remove chapters that don't serve the core theme.
**Character Progression Repairs:** Create explicit "Previous Emotional State" and "Target Growth" for each chapter. If character development stalls, add new internal conflicts that emerge from previous resolutions.
**Setting Connectivity:** Draw a physical map of arc locations and travel routes. Ensure each location has distinct character and serves specific story functions. Add transition scenes if jumps feel jarring.
**Ability Learning Curve:** Create a skill tree showing how magical/combat abilities build logically. Each chapter should unlock new techniques that solve different types of problems.
**Stakes Amplification:** List the consequences of failure for each chapter. Later chapters should threaten bigger losses (more people, permanent damage, point of no return decisions).
**Revelation Pacing:** Create a timeline of what characters know when. Spread major reveals across the arc and ensure each changes their approach to the central conflict.

**Rating System:** Provide both a numerical score (1-10) AND a PASS/NEEDS REVISION rating:
- 9-10/10 = PASS (ready for finalization)
- 1-8/10 = NEEDS REVISION (continue the revision loop)

**Scoring Standards (DO NOT LOWER THESE IN LATER CRITIQUES):**
- 10/10: Flawless execution, publishable quality
- 9/10: Minor polish needed, essentially ready
- 8/10: Good but noticeable issues that hurt reading experience  
- 7/10: Functional but multiple problems
- 6/10 and below: Major issues requiring substantial revision
- **MANDATORY REVISION LOOP**: If the numerical score is less than 9/10, you MUST create another draft and repeat the critique/revision process. Do not stop until the Arc scores 9/10 or higher. Take Final, Polish and create a file `Arcs/Arc##-final.md`

## Write Story
- Create a separate Draft document (e.g., under Archive/###/Chapter###-draft#.md)
- Use the Outline to Write the next chapter in smoothly flowing paragraph form. 
- Do not use bullet points, headers, emojis, or numbered lists.
- Use natural paragraph breaks and avoid any structural markdown elements. 
- Story should flow from chapter to chapter, avoid end of chapter summaries, or internal reflections.

### Critique Checklist
- Create a separate critique document (e.g., under Archive/###/Chapter###-draft#-critique.md)

**MANDATORY REMINDER: MAINTAIN BRUTAL STANDARDS. This is draft #[X] - do NOT lower your expectations. Find every flaw.**

Be extreamly nitpicky and preform a master level Critique, be brutally honest, providing an experienced critical analysis of this rough draft.
**Factual Consistency:** Does anything contradict `World-Bible.md`? Or `History.md`  
**Outline Adherence:** Does each scene serve the outlined beats?
**Immersion:** POV anchor: Who sees, hears, smells in this paragraph? (limit to 1–2 characters)
**List Mode Detection:** Are there 3+ consecutive sentences describing different characters' reactions? Pick only 1 or 2 characters to react. 
**Character Depth:** Does each character contribute their natural perspective (Lin-Innovation, Greta-Structure, Tobi-Flexibility, Willi-Practicality) to the situation? Dialogue should be 70% situational/emotional, 30% character quirks. Avoid repetitive "signature behavior" patterns.
**Four-Way Dynamic:** Do characters respond to each other's contributions rather than speaking in isolation? Does each bring their complementary viewpoint to problem-solving?
**Tone Alignment:** Does this match the intended arc tone from the outline?
**Show don't Tell:** Limit Exposition, when something big is happening go over the top with details. Ask “how would a reader experience this?” Convert to sensory detail.
**Pacing & Immersion:** Does each scene linger long enough for the reader to experience events in real time, with vivid sensory detail and emotional presence? Avoid summarizing or rushing through moments—let the reader see, hear, and feel the action as it unfolds, rather than being told what happened after the fact.
**Foreshadowing** Look for and assess any opertunities for forshadowing the next chapters or next Arc.
**Arc Theme Service:** How does this chapter explore a new aspect of the arc's central theme? What specific question about the theme does it answer that previous chapters haven't addressed? Referece the `Arcs/Arc04-final.md` document
**Continueity:** Does the story flow naturally from the previous chapter? Make sure there isn't any abrupt timejumps.
**Character Progression Anchoring:** Document where each main character ended emotionally in the previous chapter. What specific growth milestone will they reach? How does this build on rather than repeat previous development?
**New Discovery Requirement:** What genuinely new information, magical ability, location, or conflict is introduced? How does this expand the world/story rather than rehashing known elements?
**Stakes Progression:** Are the consequences of failure greater than in previous chapters? What new pressures force harder choices than before?
- **Geographic Continuity:** How does this location connect to previous settings? What makes it distinct and necessary for the story rather than interchangeable?

**CRITICAL: MAINTAIN BRUTAL STANDARDS THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE PROCESS. DO NOT GET SOFTER IN LATER ROUNDS.**

Imagine I said this chapter is actually terrible and will embarrass me if published. Find every flaw, no matter how minor. The goal is EXCELLENCE, not "good enough."

**Rating System:** Provide both a numerical score (1-10) AND a PASS/NEEDS REVISION rating:
- 9-10/10 = PASS (ready for finalization)
- 1-8/10 = NEEDS REVISION (continue the revision loop)

**Scoring Standards (DO NOT LOWER THESE IN LATER CRITIQUES):**
- 10/10: Flawless execution, publishable quality
- 9/10: Minor polish needed, essentially ready
- 8/10: Good but noticeable issues that hurt reading experience  
- 7/10: Functional but multiple problems
- 6/10 and below: Major issues requiring substantial revision

If large sections need to be added or expanded, give a word count estimate and directions for revision

**REMINDER: Each critique must maintain the SAME BRUTAL STANDARDS. Do not get lenient because this is the 3rd or 4th revision.**

## Story Revision
- Create the next Draft document (e.g., under Archive/###/Chapter###-draft#.md)
- Address all critique points from the Critique Checklist, making targeted changes to factual consistency, outline adherence, character depth, and tone alignment.
- Rewrite or expand scenes that feel flat, rushed, or lack emotional impact.
- Remove or revise any passages that contradict the World Bible, Narrative Bible, or established character arcs.
- Fix any "List Mode" sections by focusing reactions on one or two characters, ensuring natural flow and emotional realism.
- Strengthen dialogue: Quick sassy banter, full of life and personality.
- Enhance "show, don't tell" by adding vivid details and sensory immersion to key moments. Avoid overusing similes and metaphors—use maximum one per paragraph. Cut 70% of sensory descriptions and keep only the most impactful ones. Use dialogue to describe details when possible.
- Ensure four-way dynamic: Each character should contribute their natural perspective to problem-solving. Responses should build on what others have said rather than inserting random quirks.
- Replace repeated exposition with reaction+decision: when a fact reappears, truncate the explanation to a brief reminder and expand character reactions, choices, or consequences instead.
- Audit dialogue for redundancy: collapse duplicate lines that restate facts; use banter or conflict to reveal new angles instead.
- Check dialogue ratio: 70% situational/emotional content, 30% character personality. Friends should tease each other about predictable responses, showing familiarity.
- Ensure the story flows smoothly, with natural transitions and no abrupt summaries or internal reflections.
- **MANDATORY REVISION LOOP**: If the numerical score is less than 9/10, you MUST create another draft and repeat the critique/revision process. Do not stop until the chapter scores 9/10 or higher.
- **CONSISTENT STANDARDS WARNING**: Each new critique must maintain the SAME brutal standards as the first critique. Do not become more lenient in later rounds - if anything, become MORE demanding as the chapter should be approaching perfection.

### Finalize
- Write to Chapter document (e.g., Chapter###.md)
- **ONLY PROCEED TO FINALIZATION IF THE CHAPTER SCORED 9/10 OR HIGHER**
- Do a polishing step on the final Draft using the passing critique.
- Run one last critique of the chapter with the SAME BRUTAL STANDARDS as all previous critiques. Score it numerically (1-10). If it drops below 9/10 due to polishing errors, return to revision process.
- **FINAL QUALITY CHECK**: Ask yourself "Would I be proud to publish this chapter as-is?" If the answer isn't an enthusiastic yes, continue revisions.
