## Outline
- Create a separate outline document (e.g., Chap**Show don't Tell:** Use sensory details strategically, not constantly. One strong sensory detail per paragraph maximum. Ask "how would a reader experience this?" but don't overwhelm with sensation. When something big is happening, focus on character reactions and dialogue over environmental description.
**Sensory Overload Check:** Does every paragraph have multiple similes/metaphors? Are you describing every sense (sight, sound, smell, taste, touch) in a single scene? Cut 70% of sensory descriptions and keep only the most impactful ones. Use dialogue to convey details when possible.
**Pacing & Immersion:** Does each scene linger long enough for emotional impact without drowning in description? Avoid sensory overwhelm that slows reading to a crawl. Balance vivid detail with story momentum. Character actions and dialogue should drive scenes, not environmental descriptions.r###-outline.md)
- Start each scene with a clear problem or obstacle the characters face.
- Make a natural, mystery-driven progression (one unfolding problem -> investigations -> solution).
- Each scene starts with a clear Problem.
- Use "But/Therefore" to show each attempted solution and the resulting complication or consequence.
- Avoid jumping straight to aftermath—show the process, struggle, and decision-making.
- Each bullet should follow logically from the previous one, building tension and stakes.
- Let character choices drive the action, and let failures or partial successes lead to new problems.
- End each scene with a new challenge or turning point that sets up the next scene.
- This method keeps the story dynamic, immersive, and emotionally engaging, ensuring every event is a result of character action and world logic.
- Be as specific as possible, avoiding having the same challenge for multiple steps. 
- Every scene is driven by character choices, magical consequences, or unexpected results.
- Emotional focus and tone for the arc are defined and followed. (Cozy, Gritty, Adventurous, Powerfantasy, Dark)
- If the outline feels dense or rushed, break into multiple chapters.
- Give author direction on how far they should push a momement, for maximum effect.

### Outline Critique
Be extreamly nitpicky and through with this, you are a master editor, providing an experienced critical analysis.
- All world facts (magic, history, culture, character backgrounds) match the World Bible.
- No anachronistic references or out-of-place details.
- Character abilities, relationships, and personalities are consistent with previous chapters, and Narative-bible.md
- Check that all outline Story beats follow a logical progression that makes sense.
- Each scene starts with a clear problem or obstacle the characters face.
- Every bullet follows a logical cause-and-effect ("But/Therefore") flow.
- No jumps to aftermath—process, struggle, and decision-making are shown.
- Scene endings set up new challenges or turning points.
- Be as specific as possible, avoiding having the same challenge for multiple steps.
- Character choices drive the action; failures or partial successes lead to new problems.

### Outline Revision
- Address all critique points from the Outline Critique section, making specific changes to world facts, character consistency, and story beats.
- Clarify or expand any scenes that feel rushed, confusing, or lack emotional impact.
- Remove or rewrite any events that do not logically follow from previous chapters or character motivations.
- Ensure character arcs and relationships are clearly set up for the chapter/arc.
- Strengthen foreshadowing and setup for future magical advancements or ongoing obligations.
- Double-check that the intended emotional tone is present throughout the outline.
- Confirm that all major story beats are necessary and contribute to character growth or plot progression.
- Simplify or break up dense outlines into manageable chapters if needed.
- If the outline does not pass critique, repeat the revision and critique process until all issues are resolved and the outline is rated as passing.

## Write Story
- Create a separate Draft document (e.g., Chapter###-draft#.md)
- Use the Outline to Write the next chapter in smoothly flowing paragraph form. 
- Do not use bullet points, headers, emojis, or numbered lists.
- Use natural paragraph breaks and avoid any structural markdown elements. 
- Story should flow from chapter to chapter, avoid end of chapter summaries, or internal reflections.

### Critique Checklist
Be extreamly nitpicky and preform a master level Critique, be brutally honest, providing an experienced critical analysis of this rough draft.
**Factual Consistency:** Does anything contradict World-Bible.md? Or History.md 
**Outline Adherence:** Does each scene serve the outlined beats?
**Immersion:** POV anchor: Who sees, hears, smells in this paragraph? (limit to 1–2 characters)
**List Mode Detection:** Are there 3+ consecutive sentences describing different characters' reactions? Pick only 1 or 2 characters to react. 
**Character Depth:** Does each character contribute their natural perspective (Lin-Innovation, Greta-Structure, Tobi-Flexibility, Willi-Practicality) to the situation? Dialogue should be 70% situational/emotional, 30% character quirks. Avoid repetitive "signature behavior" patterns.
**Four-Way Dynamic:** Do characters respond to each other's contributions rather than speaking in isolation? Does each bring their complementary viewpoint to problem-solving?
**Tone Alignment:** Does this match the intended arc tone from the outline?
**Show don't Tell:** Limit Exposition, when something big is happening go over the top with details. Ask “how would a reader experience this?” Convert to sensory detail.
**Pacing & Immersion:** Does each scene linger long enough for the reader to experience events in real time, with vivid sensory detail and emotional presence? Avoid summarizing or rushing through moments—let the reader see, hear, and feel the action as it unfolds, rather than being told what happened after the fact.

Imagine I said this chapter actually is really bad and look for reasons why I said that. Nothing is perfect, just good enough. Why isn't this perfect?

## Story Revision
- Address all critique points from the Critique Checklist, making targeted changes to factual consistency, outline adherence, character depth, and tone alignment.
- Rewrite or expand scenes that feel flat, rushed, or lack emotional impact.
- Remove or revise any passages that contradict the World Bible, Narrative Bible, or established character arcs.
- Fix any "List Mode" sections by focusing reactions on one or two characters, ensuring natural flow and emotional realism.
- Strengthen dialogue: Quick sassy banter, full of life and personality.
- Enhance "show, don't tell" by adding vivid details and sensory immersion to key moments. Avoid overusing similes and metaphors—use maximum one per paragraph. Cut 70% of sensory descriptions and keep only the most impactful ones. Use dialogue to describe details when possible.
- Ensure four-way dynamic: Each character should contribute their natural perspective to problem-solving. Responses should build on what others have said rather than inserting random quirks.
- Check dialogue ratio: 70% situational/emotional content, 30% character personality. Friends should tease each other about predictable responses, showing familiarity.
- Ensure the story flows smoothly, with natural transitions and no abrupt summaries or internal reflections.
- If the rating is less than 10/10, rewrite the chapter and repeat the critique/revision process until it passes.

### Finalize
- Write to Chapter document (e.g., Chapter###.md)
- Do a polishing step on the final Draft using the passing critique.
- Run one last critique of the chapter being brutally honest looking for any flaw. Imagine I said this chapter actually is really bad and look for reasons why I said that. Nothing is perfect, just good enough. Why isn't this perfect?
