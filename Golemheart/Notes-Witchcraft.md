## Witchcraft – Eastern Magic

### Philosophy & Practice
- Witchcraft is rooted in the belief that everything has a spirit, and that creation is a sacred act. Drawing deeply from Chinese folklore and cultivation, practitioners do not simply cast spells—they build, bind, awaken, and cultivate their own spirit.
- The system is defined by its core pillars, each reflecting aspects of spiritual growth, harmony, and the pursuit of enlightenment.

### Animist Spirits & Laylines
- The land is alive, tended by Animist-style spirits—silent caretakers who dwell in the laylines, forests, and rivers. These spirits are rarely felt, but their influence is seen in the health of the land, the flow of magic, and the behavior of animals.
- Most people dismiss them as folklore, but Lin Xiu’s worldview and Witchcraft practice are deeply shaped by their presence. She senses them in places of strong magic and believes they guide, protect, and sometimes test practitioners.
- Spirits are especially important in Witchcraft: overharvesting, neglect, or disrespect can anger them, weakening magic or causing unpredictable effects. Rituals, offerings, and respectful cultivation help maintain harmony with these unseen guardians.

### Pillars of Witchcraft
- **Etching – Magic of Environment and Communication**: Witches inscribe runes, glyphs, and arrays onto surfaces or objects using brush, ink, or tools. Inspired by Chinese talismanic magic, etching creates paper talismans (fu) and charms for protection, summoning, or channeling elemental forces. Permanent runes offer long-term effects; temporary talismans are single-use. Etching is a way to commune with spirits and request their aid. Overuse can drain mana/qi or attract unwanted spirits.
- Paper talismans (fu), ritual brushes, enchanted ink
- stones with etched runes (runes, arrays, glyphs)
- Chalk / Manapen and Tablet for portable etching
- Book of Shadows, a Grimoire of Spells, Runes and Talismans, and potion reciepes

- **Threadcraft – Magic of Connection and Fate**: Witches manipulate invisible threads that bind people, places, and objects, echoing the laylines that connect all things. Used for sympathetic magic, fate weaving, and relationship bonds. Rituals involve weaving, knotting, or embroidery, sometimes using enchanted needles or string figures. Threadcraft can nudge connections, reveal destinies, or augment magic, but cannot force true love or fate. Severing threads can cause emotional pain or magical backlash.
- Spirit lanterns, used to better see Laylines they follow; sometimes used to sense Animist spirits
- Thread and needle for binding spells; enchanted needles, spirit silk
- Loop of String used for string figures
- The Athame, a knife never used to cut, exclusively to direct the Energy

- **Hearthflame – Magic of Home and Self**: Focused on warmth, sanctuary, and inner strength. Hearthflame magic nurtures, heals, and protects, using ritual fires, warding circles, and ancestor offerings. Developing one's internal heart flame (qi) is central—through meditation, tea, and emotional resilience. Hearthflame purifies spaces, restores vitality, and supports community rituals. Empathy and mental resilience are key to its strength.
- Fire pits and kilns for crafting advanced magic; warding circles, healing fires
- Censers / Incense, burned charcoal, herbs, and incese grains

- **Horticulture – Magic of Growth and Healing**: Witches cultivate magical plants, herbs, and fungi for spellwork, potions, and rituals. Gardens are sanctuaries, living wards, and sources of sentient plant companions. Practices include enchanted soil, mana-infused water, and ritual planting. Horticulture magic heals, purifies, and transforms, influenced by seasons, moon phases, and local spirits. Overharvesting or neglect can weaken magic or anger spirits.
- Pendulum - Silver chain and manacrystal weight, used to comune with and ask the spirits questions.

### Potioncraft – Magic of Transformation and Intent  
- Potioncraft distills intent into liquid form, Potions heal, reveal, protect, or transform, shaped by the brewer’s qi, seasonal timing, and spirit harmony.  
- Brewing is a ritual: enchanted vessels, Stirring patterns, breathwork, and incantations influence potency.  
- Common types include restoratives, poisons, bindings, and transformations.  
- Impure intent or corrupted ingredients can destabilize brews, causing magical backlash.

Breakthroughs require meditation, ritual, and overcoming personal or karmic obstacles.

### Limitations & Costs
- Witchcraft is physically and emotionally demanding; overuse can cause mana/qi exhaustion, emotional instability, or attract dangerous spirits.
- Some rituals are taboo or forbidden (e.g., soul binding, blood magic, reckless spirit contracts).
- Failed or corrupted magic can result in haunted golems, wild plants, broken threads, or karmic backlash that affects fate and future cultivation.
- Witchcraft cannot create life from nothing, force true love, or undo death—only guide, heal, and transform within natural limits.
- Cultivation is a lifelong journey; shortcuts often lead to disaster or spiritual imbalance.
