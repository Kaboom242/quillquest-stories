## Witchcraft – Eastern Magic

### Philosophy & Practice
- Witchcraft is rooted in the belief that everything has a spirit, and that creation is a sacred act. Drawing deeply from Chinese folklore and cultivation, practitioners do not simply cast spells—they build, bind, awaken, and cultivate their own spirit.
- The system is defined by its core pillars, each reflecting aspects of spiritual growth, harmony, and the pursuit of enlightenment.

### Animist Spirits & Laylines
- The land is alive, tended by Animist-style spirits—silent caretakers who dwell in the laylines, forests, and rivers. These spirits are rarely felt, but their influence is seen in the health of the land, the flow of magic, and the behavior of animals.
- Most people dismiss them as folklore, but Lin Xiu’s worldview and Witchcraft practice are deeply shaped by their presence. She senses them in places of strong magic and believes they guide, protect, and sometimes test practitioners.
- Spirits are especially important in Witchcraft: overharvesting, neglect, or disrespect can anger them, weakening magic or causing unpredictable effects. Rituals, offerings, and respectful cultivation help maintain harmony with these unseen guardians.

### Pillars of Witchcraft
- **Etching – Magic of the Environment and Communication**: Spells are etched into surfaces, or painted on using a brush pen and ink, using runes, glyphs, and arrays. Inspired by Chinese talismanic magic, witches inscribe paper talismans (符, fu) to ward off evil, summon spirits, or channel elemental forces. Talismans and charms are created by inscribing runes onto portable objects (paper, cloth, amulets), allowing witches to store, activate, or transfer magic. Permanent runes offer long-term effects; temporary talismans are single-use or short-term. Runes and etching is a way of asking spirits to commune with you and do magic. Whispered spells may be combined with etching for greater resonance. Some witches specialize in crafting enchanted talismans for protection, luck, or hexing and curses. Limitations: Overuse of etching can drain the witch’s mana/qi or attract unwanted spirits.
- **Threadcraft – Magic of Connection and Fate**: Binding objects, people, or places with invisible threads. (Laylines are manathreads that bind all things.) Used for sympathetic magic (e.g., a lock of hair binding two people’s fates). Threads can fray, snap, or be rewoven—symbolizing change and choice. Witches can sense and manipulate threads to influence relationships, destinies, or magical flows. Threadcraft is subtle and requires great focus; and uses a physical medium, like a tapestry, knitting, or sewing. But simple versions can be just tying a string or rope between people or fingers. Mistakes can cause unintended consequences or sever important bonds. In combat witches can sometimes be seen using a cat's cradle to leave temporary effects onto the fields, or augment themselves. Rituals may involve weaving, knotting, or embroidery. Can be enhanced by using enchanted needles, spirit silk, or even the hair of spirit beasts. Limitations: Threadcraft cannot force true love or fate, only nudge or reveal connections. Severing threads can cause emotional pain or magical backlash. Spirits are believed to tend and repair the laylines, maintaining balance.
- **Hearthflame – Magic of Home and Self**: Centered around warmth, light, and sanctuary. Fire is nurturing, not destructive—like a hearth. Ritual fires are used for ancestor offerings, burning talismans, and purifying spaces. Developing one's own internal heart fire is a core practice all witches undergo, from meditation to drinking tea. Kindle and hone your inner flame (qi). Wards, healing, and emotional resilience. Rituals include warding circles, healing fires, and the creation of protective charms. Fire pits and kilns are sacred spaces for firing clay, brewing potions, infusing thread with mana, and burning incense. Emotional states (hope, grief, joy) affect the strength and nature of hearthflame magic. Hearthflame can purify spaces, banish minor spirits, and restore vitality. It is often used in community rituals and celebrations. Limitations: a person's empathy and mental resilience play important factors in the strength of your heart flame.
- **Horticulture**: Cultivating herbs, mushrooms, and magical plants for spellwork, potions, and rituals. Witch-gardeners use enchanted soil, mana-infused water, and ritual planting to enhance potency. Alchemy and herbal medicine are central, echoing Chinese traditions of spiritual and physical healing. Plants are chosen and grown with intention; each species has unique magical properties and spiritual resonance. Gardens serve as sanctuaries and sources of living wards or sentient plant companions. Horticulture magic can heal, purify, or transform. Seasonal cycles, moon phases, and local spirits influence success and power. Magical pests, plant spirits, and weather can affect outcomes. Common practices include brewing herbal teas for healing, growing protective vines, cultivating rare fungi for advanced spellwork, and preparing elixirs for cultivation breakthroughs. Limitations: Overharvesting or neglecting the garden can weaken magic or anger local spirits. Some plants are toxic or have unpredictable effects.
