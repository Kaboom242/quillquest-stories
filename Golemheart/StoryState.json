        "personality": "Happy, sassy, idealistic, compassionate, practical, deeply believes in Animist spirits and Witchcraft traditions",
        "appearance": "Petite, with expressive dark eyes, long black hair often tied back, usually dressed in practical travel clothes and a well-worn cloak. Hands often stained with ink or clay from her magical work.",
        "description": "Native of Elarion, rare practitioner of Witchcraft, inheritor of her grandmother's manastone, skilled in claybinding, etching, threadcraft, and horticulture. Stands out for her Eastern magical philosophy and unique worldview.",

        "status": "active",
        "traits": "Protective, practical, gentle, dry-witted, subtly echoes Lin Xiu's grandmother's personality",
        "personality": "Grounded, patient, quietly observant, deadpan humor, fiercely loyal, gentle, practical counterbalance to Lin Xiu's impulsiveness. Emotional depth and self-awareness develop gradually and remain understated. Not super-sentient or sage-like; wisdom is simple, practical, and sometimes unintentionally funny. Does not experience vivid memories or mystical revelations, but mannerisms and responses occasionally reflect Lin Xiu’s grandmother in subtle ways.",
        "appearance": "Nearly seven feet tall, rough-hewn and imposing, with chisel-cut muscles, slow lumbering movements, and a mix of hard baked clay for limbs/torso and soft clay at the joints. Three thick fingers per hand, inset glowing eyes, no neck—head rises from reinforced shoulder armor with metal rings. Wears flowing red weathered cloth and silver rune-etched bracelets, with other silver metal etchings across his body. Grandmother's manastone rests in his chest like crystallized starlight, surrounded by intricate etchings and metalwork.",
        "description": "Golem companion created by Lin Xiu using her grandmother's manastone. Central to the emotional heart of the story, Cairn provides comic relief, practical advice, and stability, especially in moments of uncertainty or danger. His gradual development of self-awareness and emotional nuance is a slow-burning thread, enriching Lin Xiu’s journey with quiet connection and gentle humor.",

  "storySummary": "Lin Xiu, a rare Witchcraft practitioner, is contracted to investigate a mysterious, shape-shifting dungeon with pre-Cataclysm origins. Accompanied by her golem Cairn, she uncovers signs of ancient sentient magic, shifting runes, and the subtle influence of Animist spirits. The investigation raises questions about the dungeon’s true nature, the fate of previous survey teams, and the role of spirits in the world’s magic.",
  "worldNotes": "Witchcraft is rooted in Animist beliefs, with spirits tending laylines and influencing magic. Most people dismiss these spirits as folklore, but Lin Xiu’s practice and worldview are shaped by their presence. The distinction between Witchcraft and Western magic is central, with Witchcraft focused on harmony, intention, and listening to the world.",
