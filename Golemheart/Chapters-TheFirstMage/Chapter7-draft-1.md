# Chapter Seven: The Great Turnip Triumph

Duke Wilhelm von Königshafen's smile grew wider as he watched Big Bertha complete her formal introduction. The massive turnip had somehow managed to convey both dignity and enthusiasm in her performance, and the Duke found himself genuinely charmed by the vegetable's efforts.

"Remarkable," he said, stroking his gray beard thoughtfully. "In thirty years of hosting harvest festivals, I have never seen anything quite like this." He gestured toward the courtyard, where the other turnips had successfully completed their rescue mission and were now arranging themselves in neat rows, still humming their working songs. "They have actual personalities, don't they?"

Lin nodded, her heart still racing from the near-disaster. "Yes, Your Grace. Each one is unique."

The Duke knelt down to examine Big Bertha more closely. "And this one appears to be their leader?"

"She's very responsible," Heinrich said, finding his voice for the first time since entering the courtyard. "Always looking out for the others."

"Fascinating." The Duke stood and addressed the growing crowd of nobles and servants who had gathered to witness the spectacle. "Ladies and gentlemen, I believe we have discovered something unprecedented. Not just magical vegetables, but conscious ones with their own social structure and artistic inclinations."

A murmur ran through the crowd. Some voices carried excitement, others concern, and a few what sounded like skepticism. Lin caught sight of several richly dressed individuals whispering among themselves, their expressions ranging from curious to disapproving.

"Your Grace," said a thin man in expensive robes, stepping forward with obvious reluctance. "While this is certainly... unusual... we must consider the implications. Conscious vegetables could be seen as evidence of forbidden magical practices."

The Duke's expression hardened slightly. "Lord Aldric, are you suggesting that I cannot tell the difference between dark magic and agricultural innovation?"

"Of course not, Your Grace. I merely think we should proceed with caution. The Church has very specific teachings about the proper boundaries between the animate and inanimate."

Lin felt her stomach clench with worry. She'd been so focused on the immediate challenge of getting through the gates that she hadn't fully considered the religious implications of what she'd done. The Luminant Church had strong opinions about the natural order, and awakening consciousness in vegetables might well cross some theological line she didn't even know existed.

Greta stepped forward, her armor gleaming in the afternoon sun. "If I may, Your Grace, Lord Aldric. I am a faithful daughter of the Luminant Church, and I see nothing blasphemous in these remarkable creatures. They harm no one, help their fellow vegetables, and bring joy wherever they go. Surely the Luminant's light shines through acts of kindness and community, regardless of the form they take."

"Well said," the Duke agreed. "And you are?"

"Greta von Schnitzel, Your Grace. Knight-errant and member of the Luminous Dawn Seekers."

"Ah, adventurers. That explains the practical attitude." The Duke turned back to Lin. "And you, young lady, are clearly the mage responsible for this marvel. What is your name and training?"

"Lin Xiu, Your Grace. I'm a student at the Royal Academy in Eisenstadt, studying under Professor Aldrich."

"Aldrich? A fine educator. And what school of magic do you practice?"

Lin hesitated. This was the moment of truth, where she would have to either lie about her abilities or reveal the true nature of her power. "I practice Witchcraft, Your Grace. It's... a new discipline."

The crowd's murmur grew louder at this admission. Lord Aldric's face paled, and several other nobles stepped back as if Lin had announced she carried a plague.

"Witchcraft," the Duke repeated thoughtfully. "An ancient term. Are you claiming to practice the old ways?"

"Not exactly, Your Grace. I'm creating new ways, based on old wisdom my grandmother taught me. The principle is partnership rather than domination, listening rather than commanding."

Big Bertha chose that moment to roll closer to the Duke and begin what sounded like an enthusiastic endorsement of Lin's character. Her voice rose and fell in patterns that seemed almost conversational, and several of the other turnips joined in what appeared to be supporting testimony.

The Duke listened to this vegetable chorus with growing amusement. "They seem quite fond of you," he observed.

"The feeling is mutual, Your Grace."

"Excellent. Then you won't mind giving us a demonstration of this partnership-based magic?"

Lin's mouth went dry. A demonstration, here, in front of dozens of nobles and servants, with Lord Aldric already looking for reasons to condemn her? "I... what would you like me to demonstrate, Your Grace?"

"Something appropriate for a harvest festival. Something that celebrates the bounty of the land and the joy of community."

Lin looked around the courtyard, her mind racing. The festival decorations were beautiful but static—garlands of autumn leaves, displays of prize vegetables, banners hanging limply in the still air. What could she do that would be impressive but not threatening, magical but not forbidden?

Her gaze fell on a cart of apples that had been overturned during the turnip rescue operation. The fruit lay scattered across the cobblestones, and several servants were beginning to gather them up. An idea began to form.

"Willi," she called softly. "Do you have any of those special cooking spices with you?"

Willi's eyes lit up with understanding. "Always, dear. What did you have in mind?"

"A feast. A harvest feast that celebrates everything good about the season."

Lin walked over to the scattered apples, her blackthorn staff humming with gentle warmth in her hands. She knelt among the fruit and pressed her palm to the cobblestones, feeling for the laylines that ran beneath the castle. They were strong here, golden threads of power that spoke of centuries of celebration and community.

"With your permission, Your Grace, I'd like to awaken not consciousness, but simply joy. The simple happiness that comes from good food shared with friends."

The Duke nodded, his eyes bright with curiosity.

Lin closed her eyes and reached out with her magic, not to the apples themselves but to the memories they carried. Memories of summer sunshine, of gentle rain, of the patient gardener who had tended the orchard. She asked permission from the spirits of the harvest, the small voices that whispered in every grain and fruit and leaf.

Then she began to sing.

It was a song her grandmother had taught her, wordless and ancient, a melody that spoke of gratitude and abundance and the eternal cycle of growth and harvest. Willi joined her voice to the song, adding harmonies that seemed to make the very air shimmer with warmth.

The apples began to glow.

Not with the harsh light of standard magic, but with the gentle golden radiance of a perfect sunset. They rose from the ground one by one, spinning slowly in the air as they arranged themselves in a complex pattern above the courtyard. The scent that filled the air was intoxicating—fresh apple pie, mulled cider, the crisp sweetness of fruit picked at perfect ripeness.

But the magic didn't stop with the apples. The other fruits and vegetables in the courtyard began to respond, adding their own voices to the song Lin had started. Pumpkins glowed with warm orange light, grapes shimmered purple and green, and even the rescued squash hummed with contentment.

The turnips, not to be outdone, arranged themselves in a circle beneath the floating apples and began to provide what could only be described as a bass line to the growing symphony of flavors and light.

The effect was breathtaking. The entire courtyard had become a living celebration of the harvest, with every fruit and vegetable contributing to a display that was part light show, part concert, and part advertisement for the finest produce in the kingdom.

The crowd that had gathered was now completely silent, staring up at the magical display with wonder and delight. Even Lord Aldric seemed momentarily speechless, his objections forgotten in the face of such beautiful and obviously benevolent magic.

Duke Wilhelm began to applaud, slowly at first, then with growing enthusiasm. "Magnificent!" he declared. "Absolutely magnificent! This is exactly what our harvest festival needed—magic that celebrates life rather than commanding it, beauty that brings people together rather than driving them apart."

The floating apples began to descend, settling gently into baskets that Willi had quickly arranged around the courtyard. As they touched down, their glow faded but their enhanced scent remained, filling the air with the promise of the most delicious feast anyone could imagine.

"Your Grace," Lin said, her voice slightly breathless from the magic she'd just worked, "the apples are enhanced but not changed. They'll make the finest pies and cider you've ever tasted, but they're still just apples. The magic was in the celebration, not in transforming their essential nature."

"Perfect," the Duke said. "Lord Aldric, surely even you cannot object to magic that makes our harvest feast more delicious?"

Lord Aldric was clearly struggling to find grounds for complaint. "It's... certainly impressive, Your Grace. Though I still have concerns about the theological implications of conscious vegetables."

Big Bertha rolled over to Lord Aldric and began what sounded like a gentle lecture on the virtues of peaceful coexistence. Her tone was patient but firm, and by the time she finished, the thin nobleman was looking distinctly uncomfortable.

"The turnip makes some excellent points," the Duke said with barely concealed amusement. "Now then, let's discuss business. Master Heinrich, I assume you're here to sell your remarkable crop?"

Heinrich stepped forward, his face cycling through relief, terror, and hope in rapid succession. "Yes, Your Grace. Though given their... unique nature... I'm not entirely sure how to price them."

"Hmm. Conscious vegetables capable of musical performance, agricultural consultation, and apparently theological debate." The Duke stroked his beard thoughtfully. "I'd say they're worth considerably more than ordinary turnips, wouldn't you?"

"I... suppose so, Your Grace?"

"I'll take the entire crop. Fifty gold per turnip."

The courtyard fell completely silent. Heinrich's mouth opened and closed soundlessly, his face turning the color of his turnips. Fifty gold per turnip meant over two thousand gold for the entire crop—enough money to buy a small farm, or live comfortably for several years.

"Your Grace," Lord Aldric protested, "that's an extraordinary sum for vegetables, conscious or not."

"These aren't just vegetables," the Duke replied firmly. "They're performers, companions, and quite possibly the most unique addition to any noble's household in the history of the kingdom. I suspect other courts will be quite jealous when word spreads."

Lin felt a pang of worry at the thought of the turnips being separated and sold to different households, possibly treated as curiosities rather than individuals. "Your Grace, if I may... the turnips have formed a community. They care for each other. Separating them might cause them distress."

"An excellent point. They'll remain together, of course. I'm thinking of establishing them in the castle's east garden, with their own dedicated caretaker. They can perform for guests, help with the general garden work, and live as comfortable a life as any vegetable could desire."

Big Bertha's enthusiastic response suggested this arrangement met with turnip approval.

Heinrich finally found his voice. "Fifty gold each? You're... you're serious?"

"Completely serious. Payable immediately, in good silver and gold. I'll also need you to stay for a few days to help with the transition and to advise my gardeners on their care and feeding."

"Care and feeding," Heinrich repeated weakly. "Right. Of course. Conscious turnips need special care."

"Indeed they do. And I suspect your witch friend here will want to visit periodically to ensure their wellbeing?"

Lin nodded eagerly. "If you'd permit it, Your Grace. I feel responsible for them."

"Naturally. You'll always be welcome at Königshafen, Miss Lin. In fact, I'd like to commission some additional work from you. The castle gardens could use someone with your particular talents, and I have several other agricultural projects that might benefit from partnership-based magic."

The offer was tempting, but Lin knew her path lay elsewhere. "I'm honored, Your Grace, but I need to return to my studies. There's still so much I don't understand about my own abilities."

"Of course. But the offer stands whenever you're ready. And I'll be sending a letter to Professor Aldrich, recommending you for advanced independent study. What you've accomplished here is remarkable."

As the afternoon wore on, the harvest festival resumed around them with the turnips as the undisputed stars of the show. They performed for delighted children, advised other merchants on the care of their produce, and generally charmed everyone they encountered. Heinrich found himself the center of attention as the farmer who had somehow grown the kingdom's first conscious vegetables, and his initial terror gradually gave way to pride and amazement.

The Luminous Dawn Seekers spent the evening as guests of honor at the Duke's feast, where the magically enhanced apples were indeed transformed into the most delicious pies and cider anyone had ever tasted. Lin found herself seated at the high table, fielding questions about Witchcraft from curious nobles while trying not to reveal too much about abilities she was still learning to control.

"The key," she explained to a fascinated duchess, "is listening rather than commanding. When you approach magic as a partnership instead of a tool, the results are often surprising and beautiful."

"But surely there must be limits?" the duchess pressed. "Things that shouldn't be awakened or changed?"

Lin thought of the blackthorn's warnings about spirits that would lie and hunger for her gifts. "Absolutely. That's why respect and caution are so important. Magic is powerful, but wisdom is knowing when not to use it."

As the evening wound down, Heinrich approached their table with a mixture of gratitude and melancholy. The sale of his turnips had made him wealthy beyond his wildest dreams, but Lin could see he was struggling with saying goodbye to creatures that had become more than just crop.

"They'll be happy here," she assured him. "The Duke genuinely cares about their wellbeing, and they'll have each other."

"I know. It's just... strange to think they won't be coming home with me. Though I suppose they've outgrown my little farm anyway."

Big Bertha rolled over to Heinrich and began what sounded like an elaborate thank-you speech, complete with promises to visit and updates on their new life. Heinrich listened with tears in his eyes, occasionally responding as if he could understand every word.

"You can visit anytime," the Duke assured him. "They're part of the family now, but you'll always be their first friend."

The next morning brought farewells and final arrangements. The turnips had spent the night exploring their new garden home and seemed delighted with the spacious beds, the variety of other plants to befriend, and the fountain that burbled cheerfully in the center of their domain.

Lin knelt in the garden soil one last time, pressing her palm to the earth and reaching out with her magic to ensure the turnips would be comfortable and safe. The laylines here were strong and peaceful, and she could sense the approval of the garden's resident spirits.

"Be good," she whispered to the turnips. "Be happy. And if you ever need anything, just ask the spirits to send word to me."

Big Bertha's response was warm with affection and gratitude, and the other turnips added their own voices to what sounded like a promise to make her proud.

Heinrich received his payment in a ceremony that half the city seemed to attend. Two thousand, one hundred and fifty gold pieces—enough to transform him from a struggling farmer into one of the wealthiest merchants in the region. The Duke also presented him with a letter of introduction that would open doors at courts throughout the kingdom.

"You're the man who grew the first conscious vegetables," the Duke explained. "That's going to be worth more than gold in the right circles. Nobles will pay handsomely for even ordinary produce from the farmer who achieved the impossible."

As the Luminous Dawn Seekers prepared to leave Königshafen, Lin felt a complex mixture of emotions. They'd succeeded beyond anyone's wildest expectations, the turnips were safe and happy, and Heinrich had been rewarded far beyond the value of any normal crop. But she also felt the weight of new responsibilities and the knowledge that word of her abilities would soon spread far beyond this single duchy.

"Ready for the return journey?" Greta asked, checking the straps on her armor one final time.

"More than ready," Tobi said, hefting his pack with obvious satisfaction. The Duke had been generous with gifts for the entire party, and Tobi's share of Heinrich's gratitude payment had left him with more coin than he'd ever possessed at one time.

Willi climbed into the wagon seat beside Heinrich, who had offered to drive them back to Eisenstadt before continuing on to explore his new opportunities. "I still can't believe it all worked out so well," she said, shaking her head in amazement.

"It worked out because we trusted each other," Lin replied, settling beside her friends with her blackthorn staff warm against her palm. "The turnips, Heinrich, all of us—we became a community instead of just individuals trying to solve separate problems."

As their wagon rolled out of Königshafen's gates, Lin turned for one last look at the castle gardens. She could just make out the turnips in their new home, already busy helping the ducal gardeners with the morning planting. Big Bertha raised her leafy top in what might have been a wave.

The road back to Eisenstadt stretched ahead of them, and Lin knew that when they arrived, she would have to explain her adventures to Professor Aldrich and the Guild authorities. The thought should have been terrifying, but instead she felt a quiet confidence that hadn't been there when they'd first set out.

She was no longer just a confused student accidentally awakening vegetables. She was Lin Xiu, the First Witch, and she was beginning to understand what that meant.

The journey home would give her time to prepare for whatever came next.
