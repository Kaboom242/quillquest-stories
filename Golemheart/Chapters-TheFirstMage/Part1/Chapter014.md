# Chapter 14: Evernight at Rowan Hollow

The countryside rolled past Lin's horse in waves of amber light that should have been afternoon sunshine but felt wrong against her skin. She shifted in her saddle and pressed her blackthorn staff against her knee, the Forest Spirit within recoiling from whatever tainted the air around them. The wrongness tasted like copper pennies and stale breath, as if the world had been holding its lungs closed for hours.

Lin tilted her head back to study the sun, which hung motionless in a sky the color of old honey. Her shadow stretched in the same direction it had when they'd stopped for lunch, and before that, and before that. Time wasn't just slow here—it was broken.

"Anyone else notice we've been riding toward that same cloud for three hours?" Tobi asked, pointing at a wispy formation that should have drifted away by now. He strummed a few experimental notes on his lute, the melody hanging in the still air longer than it should. "Either my music's gotten incredibly compelling, or we're stuck in the world's most ominous painting."

"Perfect," Lin said with forced lightness. "I've always wanted to be an extra in an ominous tableau."

Greta barked a short laugh without humor. "If you're going to be dramatic, at least look heroic while you do it."

Willi folded her hands around a wrapped loaf. "Heroism is overrated when it's empty stomach heroism," she said practically. "Here, eat." She offered Lin half the loaf—the gesture was matter-of-fact, not sentimental, but Lin felt steadier for it.

Tobi accepted a scrap and grinned. "See? Food fixes everything—except time. Time seems stubbornly carb-free."

Greta's armored boots clinked against her stirrups as she shifted to look around them, her expression growing serious again. "The Light preserve us. This is no natural phenomenon." Her voice carried the weight of someone who'd seen corruption before, but nothing quite like this. "How long since anyone has seen proper dawn or dusk in these lands?"

"Two weeks," Willi said grimly, consulting the Guild posting she'd been studying. "Since the dungeon break. Village has been sending messengers, but most never made it out. The few that did..." She shook her head. "They spoke of people trapped in endless repetition."

As they crested the final hill, Rowan Hollow spread below them like a music box with a broken spring. Lin counted the baker's movements as he carried the same tray past the same window—once, twice, three times in perfect intervals. The same loaf of bread, the same careful step around the same loose cobblestone, the same wave to the same woman hanging the same three shirts on the same section of line.

"Fresh bread! Finest in the valley!" the baker called, his voice carrying across the unnatural stillness. Exactly three minutes and forty-seven seconds later, he repeated the call with identical inflection.

Lin's stomach clenched as she watched the woman hanging laundry. Each time, she pinned the blue shirt first, then the white one, then the child's tunic. But with every repetition, her movements grew slightly more mechanical, her eyes a little more vacant. How long before these people forgot who they were entirely?

"We need to map this carefully before we do anything else," Willi said, dismounting and pulling out her notebook. "See how far the temporal boundaries extend, what patterns we're dealing with."

Lin slid down from her horse and immediately extended her awareness toward the laylines that should flow beneath the village like underground rivers. The moment her consciousness touched them, agony exploded through her skull like lightning striking bone. She cried out and stumbled, clutching her staff as waves of wrongness crashed over her magical senses.

The laylines weren't flowing—they writhed like wounded animals, twisted into impossible knots that pulsed with sick red light. Each pulse sent needles of pain straight through her temples and down her spine. She tried to trace the source of the torture, but the magical currents flinched away from her touch like things in too much agony to bear contact.

"They're not just damaged," she gasped, pressing her free hand to her forehead where a vicious headache was building. "Something's feeding on them, twisting them deliberately. The laylines are screaming."

They spent the next hour walking the village perimeter, Lin fighting nausea with each step closer to the temporal distortions. The loops weren't uniform—some villagers repeated three-minute cycles, others stretched to twelve minutes or more. A blacksmith raised and lowered his hammer in perfect rhythm, the same three strikes on the same horseshoe that would never be finished. Two children played an eternal game of catch, their laughter echoing the same notes at the same intervals until the sound became a mockery of joy.

When Willi approached an elderly woman sweeping her doorstep, Lin watched the interaction with growing dread. The woman looked up with eyes that seemed to see through them to something far away and long past.

"Harvest day, dear," the woman said, her voice hollow as an echo in an empty well. "Always harvest day in Rowan Hollow. Been blessed with such fine weather, praise the Light." She returned to sweeping, each stroke covering the exact same three-foot patch of stone she'd been scrubbing clean for two weeks.

"How long has it been harvest day?" Willi asked gently.

"Why, today of course!" The woman's response came too quickly, too cheerfully, like a music box ballerina wound too tight. "Such a lovely harvest day. Been blessed with such fine weather, praise the Light." The words began repeating even as she spoke them, layering over themselves until they became meaningless noise.

A low humming drifted across the village, barely audible but persistent. Lin felt it in her teeth, in the hollow spaces between her ribs. The sound matched the rhythm of the corrupted laylines' convulsions, and when she turned toward the ancient forest that bordered the village's northern edge, the humming grew stronger.

"There," she said, pointing toward the treeline where the air seemed to shimmer with heat that had nothing to do with temperature. "Whatever's doing this is in those woods."

The walk to the forest felt longer than it should have, each step taking them further from the broken normalcy of the village and closer to something that made Lin's skin crawl with anticipation. The forest entrance loomed before them like a mouth full of broken teeth, and as they approached, Lin saw they weren't alone.

Dozens of spirits clustered around the treeline, but these weren't the peaceful woodland sprites she'd expected. Their small bodies pressed together in desperate huddles, chittering warnings in voices like glass breaking against stone.

"Turn back! Turn back!" A tuckling burst from behind a tree trunk, its bark-skin mottled with stress patterns that looked like infected wounds. "Great hunger wakes! Old promises break! No passage for warm-bloods!"

More spirits emerged from hiding—rootlings that should have been tending forest growth instead twisted their branches into barrier patterns, while shadow-wisps darted between the trees like living warning flags. They weren't attacking, Lin realized. They were terrified, trying to protect them from something that had traumatized every living thing in the forest.

"What's got you all so scared?" she asked softly, kneeling among the panicked spirits. She could feel their terror like a physical weight, pressing against her chest until breathing became difficult.

The brave tuckling approached her outstretched hand with obvious reluctance. When its tiny branch touched her finger, images flooded her mind—flashes of something ancient and beloved writhing in pain, of laylines twisted into knots of agony, of a presence that had once been protector becoming predator.

"Oh," Lin breathed, tears stinging her eyes as she understood. "You're trying to protect us from something you love. Something that's been corrupted beyond recognition."

Willi knelt beside her and began humming a gentle lullaby, the melody floating through the air like warm honey. Several spirits stopped their frantic chittering to listen, their panic easing slightly at the comforting sound.

Greta stepped forward with solemn dignity. "By the Light that guides all souls to righteousness," she said formally, placing her hand over her heart, "we swear we come not as conquerors but as healers. Honor demands we attempt to mend what has been broken, to ease the suffering that drives good spirits to such desperation."

Tobi sat on a fallen log and pulled out his lute, his usual mischievous grin replaced by quiet focus. "Hey, little ones," he said gently, beginning to play a soft melody that complemented Willi's humming. "We've seen broken things before. Sometimes they can be fixed, if someone cares enough to try. Will you let us try?"

The spirits wavered between terror and desperate hope. Finally, the tuckling spoke for all of them: "Warm-bloods may pass. But beware—great tree grieves beyond healing. Ancient hunger grows beyond stopping. Old friend becomes old enemy, and we cannot save what will not be saved."

The wall of spirits parted reluctantly, creating a narrow path between the trees. The moment they stepped across the threshold, Lin felt something fundamental shift in the air around them. The temperature dropped until her breath came out in visible puffs, and shadows moved independently of any light source, reaching toward them with finger-like tendrils.

"This darkness isn't natural," Greta muttered, her sword hand twitching toward her hilt. Her voice carried an edge Lin had rarely heard before—not fear exactly, but deep unease. "It presses against the soul like a physical weight."

Lin pulled out a torch and struck flint, but the flame guttered weakly in the supernatural gloom. "Normal light won't work here," she realized, watching their pitiful circle of illumination shrink to barely an arm's length. "The corruption is too thick. I can't read the laylines properly through all this interference."

An idea sparked in her memory—half-remembered lessons from her grandmother about tools that could see through spiritual darkness. "I need to make something new. A Spirit-lantern that can pierce through corruption like this."

Lin settled cross-legged on the forest floor, her friends forming a protective circle around her. She pulled out silk thread that shimmered with its own faint luminescence, a small crystal from Tobi's collection that caught even the dim light, and her grandmother's etching stylus with its worn bone handle.

The work demanded absolute precision. Each spirit-thread had to be woven through specific points on the crystal's surface, creating pathways for spiritual energy to flow without the layline corruption interfering. Lin's fingers cramped from the delicate movements, and sweat beaded on her forehead despite the unnatural chill.

"Little spirits," she whispered as she worked, keeping her voice gentle and inviting. "I need a partner—someone brave enough to help guide us through this darkness. Someone who wants to heal the pain poisoning your home."

A tiny spark of light drifted down from the branches above, no larger than her thumb and pulsing with nervous energy. Lin held perfectly still as it circled the crystal, investigating her work with the careful attention of a master craftsman examining another's technique.

"Hello there," she said softly. "We're partners in this, not master and servant. You can leave anytime if you don't like what we're doing. We're just asking for your help to see clearly in places where normal sight fails."

The spirit settled onto the crystal with a sound like wind chimes made of silver and starlight. Lin could feel its curiosity mixing with deep worry about whatever waited in the forest's heart, but also a tentative hope that maybe, just maybe, these strange warm-bloods might actually be able to help.

When the weaving was complete, Lin cupped the finished lantern in both hands and took a steadying breath. "This is going to hurt," she warned her friends. "Hearthflame is part of my life force. Giving it away means giving away part of myself."

She opened her inner flame with careful deliberation, feeling the warm golden energy that lived at her core—the part of her that was most essentially Lin Xiu, that made her more than just flesh and bone. Then, with an act of will that felt like tearing off a piece of her own soul, she breathed a stream of pure Hearthflame into the crystal.

The world immediately became colder and more distant. Colors drained from her vision as exhaustion hit like a physical blow, leaving her swaying and hollow. If Willi hadn't caught her shoulders, she would have collapsed face-first into the forest loam.

But the Spirit-lantern blazed to life with soft, steady radiance that seemed to warm the air for several feet around them. The little spirit inside chimed contentedly, its fear transforming into determination now that it had purpose and protection.

"Thank you," Lin whispered to her ethereal partner, hanging the lantern from her staff with hands that shook like autumn leaves. "Now let's see what we're really dealing with."

The lantern's light revealed a landscape transformed by corruption. Laylines became visible as ribbons of sickly red energy, all flowing toward the forest's heart like blood drawn toward an open wound. Small spirits clustered around the trees—not healthy woodland sprites, but creatures driven half-mad by pain they couldn't escape. Most disturbing of all, Lin could see the corruption itself: veins of oily darkness running through everything, pulsing with a malevolent hunger that made her stomach turn.

"Something's feeding," she said, her voice barely above a whisper. "Not just consuming the laylines for power, but actively torturing them. Making them hurt on purpose."

As they prepared to venture deeper into the forest, the Spirit-lantern attracted attention from local spirits who emerged from hiding with desperate hope written across their small faces. Tucklings with expressions of too-human pain gathered around Willi when she offered them crumbs of travel bread. Shadow-wisps flickered between visibility, too damaged to maintain solid form but drawn to the healing light like moths to flame.

"The path winds true but danger grows," the spirit in the lantern chimed, its voice like silver bells touched with ancient sorrow. "Ancient friend sleeps in pain, dreams in hunger. We guide where feet may walk, but hearts must be strong for what waits ahead."

The path wound deeper into the haunted woods, shifting constantly as passages that had been clear moments before would suddenly branch in different directions. Lin had to trust the little spirit's guidance to avoid walking in circles, while behind her she could hear Greta's breathing grow shorter and more controlled as the supernatural darkness pressed in from all sides.

Finally, after what felt like hours of careful navigation through the maze of corrupted trees, they emerged into a clearing where a single massive Rowan tree stood at the center. Its trunk easily measured sixty feet around, and its canopy disappeared into the supernatural gloom above. But this wasn't the majestic guardian it should have been.

Dark veins pulsed through its bark like infected arteries, and the air around it hummed with the same painful frequency that had echoed through the village. The tree's presence filled the clearing with an aura of ancient grief so profound that Lin felt tears spring to her eyes without knowing why.

"There," she breathed, feeling the Spirit-lantern's light waver as they approached the source of all this torment. "That's what's been feeding on the laylines. But once upon a time, this was something beautiful, wasn't it?"

The massive Rowan tree loomed before them, its corrupted form radiating centuries of pain and twisted hunger, waiting for them to draw close enough to understand what tragedy had transformed a forest guardian into an engine of temporal torment.

The massive Rowan tree's presence crashed over Lin like a wave of liquid sorrow, ancient grief so thick she could taste it—metallic and bitter, like blood mixed with tears that had been crying for centuries. Her knees nearly buckled as the tree's consciousness pressed against her mind, and she had to grip her staff with both hands to stay upright.

Through the Spirit-lantern's trembling light, she watched dark veins pulse beneath the bark like infected arteries, each throb sending that nauseating hum through her bones. The corruption wasn't just magical—it was emotional, raw agony given form and allowed to fester until it had become something hungry and desperate.

A sound emerged from the tree that made Lin's chest constrict with sympathetic pain. Not quite a groan, not quite a sob, but something that belonged to both categories and neither. The voice that formed in her mind felt like touching a wound that had never been allowed to heal: *Help... me... cannot... stop...*

"It's still conscious," Lin whispered, stepping closer despite her body's desperate urge to flee. "I can feel it trying to speak, but the corruption is like—like screaming over a whisper."

Before anyone could respond, the tree pulsed again and reality fractured around them. Lin suddenly experienced every second of the past two weeks compressed into a single, agonizing moment. She felt the tree's slow descent into madness, the gradual poisoning of every layline connection, the helpless horror of watching the village trap itself in endless loops while being unable to stop feeding on their temporal energy. When the vision released her, she was on her knees in the forest loam, retching.

Willi's hands found her shoulders, steadying but not restraining. "What did you see?"

"The dungeon break," Lin gasped, wiping her mouth with a shaking hand. "When the Academy's wards failed, the magical feedback traveled through every layline for miles. But this tree was already weakened—I think by simple old age and isolation. The shock pushed it over the edge."

The tree shuddered at her words, and she felt another spike of its consciousness touch hers—not words this time, but pure emotion. Desperate, clawing fear at the thought of death, but underneath that, something worse: the fear of being forgotten, of having all its centuries of protection and care erased by this final act of corruption.

"It doesn't want to die," Lin said, tears she didn't remember shedding hot on her cheeks. "It remembers being a guardian. Centuries of sheltering spirits, protecting travelers, helping things grow. It's terrified that all of that will be lost if we have to destroy it."

Tobi moved closer, and Lin could hear his breathing change as the tree's emotional weight hit him too. His usual easy grin had vanished, replaced by something softer and more serious than she'd ever seen from him. When he spoke, his voice was gentle as rain on new leaves.

"Hey there, ancient one," he said, pulling his lute into position. "You've been hurting for a long time, haven't you?" The melody he began was nothing like his usual cheerful songs—this was something that sounded like forgiveness, like the promise that pain doesn't last forever.

The tree's agonized groaning softened slightly as the music washed over it, and Lin felt some of the violence go out of the pulsing corruption. But she could see it wasn't enough. The darkness ran too deep, had too many years to take root.

"I need to use Threadcraft," she said, though the thought of working such delicate magic so close to so much corruption made her stomach clench. "Not to force it back to health—I don't think that's possible. But maybe I can help it remember what it chose to be, before the pain made it forget."

She approached the tree's base where the corruption was thickest, each step feeling like walking through cold honey that tried to pull her down. When she placed her palm against the twisted bark, agony shot up her arm like lightning made of broken glass. She bit her tongue hard enough to taste blood, but held the connection, reaching deeper with her magical senses.

There. Buried beneath layers of accumulated anguish and twisted magic, she found what she was looking for—a tiny seed of the tree's original nature, still pure, still remembering its purpose. But reaching it would mean diving through all that corruption, exposing herself to the same madness that had claimed the tree.

Willi knelt behind her without being asked, pressing one warm palm against Lin's back right over her heart. "I'm here," she said simply. "Breathe with me when you get lost."

Lin felt Greta's presence at the edge of the clearing, solid and protective as a stone wall. The knight's voice carried the weight of absolute conviction: "I'll watch for the corruption trying to spread. If I say retreat, you listen."

Tobi's music shifted, becoming something that felt like a rope of light cast into dark water. "Follow the melody if you can't find your way back," he called softly. "I'll keep playing until you're home."

Lin closed her eyes and let her consciousness sink into the tree's mind.

The corruption hit her like being thrown into a maelstrom of liquid madness. Centuries of accumulated pain crashed over her in waves—every moment of confusion, every flash of rage, every second of helpless hunger as the tree consumed the very things it had once protected. She felt herself beginning to dissolve into the ancient guardian's anguish, losing track of where Lin ended and the tree began.

But Willi's hand was an anchor, warm and steady as a heartbeat. Tobi's music was a lifeline, weaving through the chaos like golden thread. And ahead, through the storm of corruption, she could sense that tiny spark of the tree's true self.

The Threadcraft she began weaving wasn't meant to heal or repair—it was meant to remember. Each thread she laid down carried a specific memory of what the tree had been: the guardian who had grown a canopy of shelter for three lost children during the worst blizzard in living memory. The ancient friend who had hummed lullabies to frightened sprites when storms broke their courage. The patient teacher who had helped saplings learn to root deep and grow strong.

The corruption fought back viciously, trying to twist her memories into nightmares of failure and abandonment. Each thread she placed, the darkness tried to corrupt with visions of every traveler who had died despite the tree's protection, every storm that had been too strong, every time caring hadn't been enough.

But Lin held firm to the moments of light. She wove the memory of lovers carving their initials into bark that healed around the wounds like a blessing. She spun threads of spring mornings when the tree's song had called birds back from their winter homes. She anchored every stitch with the truth that choosing to care, even when it hurt, was what made someone a guardian.

The breakthrough came like a dam bursting. The tree's consciousness suddenly blazed with recognition, washing away the corruption like sunlight burning off fog. The dark veins pulsing through the bark began to fade, and the agonized groaning transformed into something that sounded almost like laughter—old and tired, but genuine.

Lin opened her eyes to find the tree transformed. Silver-gray bark gleamed in the Spirit-lantern's light, and healthy leaves rustled with the sound of contentment. The air no longer tasted of pain and metal, but of growing things and morning dew.

"Thank you," the tree's voice whispered in her mind, clear as a bell and warm as summer honey. "I remember now. I remember what I am."

The restoration spread outward from the tree like dawn breaking, and Lin felt it happening through every connection she'd woven. Corrupted spirits throughout the forest suddenly straightened as centuries of pain lifted from their small shoulders. The oppressive darkness dissolved, replaced by the soft silver light of a healthy forest evening.

In the distance, she could hear voices from Rowan Hollow—confused calls, then shouts of joy as people realized they could move freely again, that tomorrow was finally coming.

Lin leaned back against the tree's trunk, exhausted but smiling as the guardian's contentment flowed through her like warm wine. The Spirit-lantern in her hand chimed once, happily, as the little spirit inside felt the forest's return to health.

"Is it finished?" Greta asked, and Lin could hear the knight's relief in the way her armor creaked as tension finally left her shoulders.

"It's finished," Lin confirmed, looking up at the tree's canopy where spirits were beginning to emerge from hiding, their small faces bright with wonder. "The guardian remembers itself, and the laylines are flowing clean again."

As they prepared to leave the clearing, the tree's voice touched her mind one last time: "The village will need watching. What happened here has weakened the barriers between worlds. I will stand guard as I always have, but strange things may slip through in the coming months. Will you remember to check on us?"

Lin pressed her palm against the bark once more, sealing the promise. Their work here was finished, but the connections they'd forged would need tending for years to come. That was the nature of healing—it created new responsibilities, new threads that bound communities together.

They walked back through the healthy forest in comfortable silence, following paths lit by natural moonlight filtering through leaves that whispered with contentment. Behind them, the guardian settled into its watch, once again the protector it had always been meant to be.
