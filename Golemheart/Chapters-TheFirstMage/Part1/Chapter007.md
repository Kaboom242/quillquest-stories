# Chapter Seven: The Price of Wonder

The forty-three turnips had stopped humming.

Duke Wilhelm von Königshafen stood in the sudden silence of his courtyard, surrounded by vegetables that had just demonstrated consciousness, intelligence, and—if Lin was reading their body language correctly—mounting anxiety about the stares they were receiving from every merchant, noble, and servant within hearing distance. Big Bertha had positioned herself protectively in front of the smaller turnips, while several others were attempting what could only be called hiding behind Heinrich's boots.

Lin felt her stomach twist into knots that had nothing to do with hunger. This was definitely not how she'd imagined their turnip delivery going.

"Well," the Duke said, and Lin caught something in his voice that might have been amusement, "this is certainly more interesting than the usual harvest festival."

"Your Grace—" Lord Brennan began, his thin face pinched with the expression of someone who'd just watched the natural order crumble into amusing but heretical pieces.

"Is fascinated by magical innovation," the Duke finished smoothly, his gray eyes twinkling with what Lin was beginning to recognize as dangerous political maneuvering. "Aren't you, Brennan? Just this morning you were telling me how the kingdom needs to encourage young mages to push boundaries."

Lord Brennan's mouth opened and closed like a fish gasping for air, which was honestly a bit unfair to fish, who at least had the excuse of being out of their element.

Lin felt Willi's hand settle on her shoulder—warm, reassuring, and slightly protective in a way that made her chest tight with gratitude. "Whatever happens," Willi murmured, her voice barely audible, "we're in this together."

Tobi had somehow drifted closer without seeming to move, his usual irreverent grin replaced by the alert tension of someone ready to run or fight depending on how the next few minutes unfolded. "So," he said conversationally, as if conscious vegetables were a perfectly normal marketplace occurrence, "anyone else thinking this is either going to end brilliantly or catastrophically, with no middle ground whatsoever?"

"That's been my life since I met Lin," Greta observed dryly from her position near the wagon, though Lin could see her calculating distances to exits and potential threats with the methodical precision of someone whose job was keeping idiots alive. "I've learned to expect the unexpected and pack accordingly."

"You pack for unexpected conscious vegetables?" Tobi asked with interest.

"I pack for whatever Lin's magic might decide to do next. Today that happened to be vegetables. Tomorrow it might be the castle's stone gargoyles."

"Please don't give me ideas," Lin muttered, though she was grateful for the familiar banter. Her friends' easy humor made even this impossible situation feel manageable.

"Heinrich," the Duke continued, seemingly oblivious to their whispered conversation, his attention shifting to the farmer, who looked like he was contemplating whether burial alive might be preferable to his current situation. "These are your turnips, correct?"

"Y-yes, Your Grace. Königshafen Purple Hearts, grown on my farm outside Millbrook." Heinrich's voice cracked worse than a boy's in the middle of changing seasons. "Though I'm not certain they qualify as normal turnips anymore."

One of the smaller turnips chirped something that sounded distinctly offended, which made Lin bite back a completely inappropriate giggle. Even in crisis, the turnips maintained their personalities.

"Apparently not," the Duke agreed, and Lin was startled to hear genuine amusement in his voice rather than the outrage or fear she'd been expecting. "The question becomes what exactly we're dealing with, and what should be done about it." His gaze found Lin. "You would be the young lady responsible for this transformation?"

Lin's throat felt like she'd been eating sand, but she managed to nod. "Lin Xiu, Your Grace. And the responsibility is entirely mine." She paused, then added with the honesty that always seemed to get her into trouble, "Though I should probably mention that I didn't exactly plan for this to happen."

"Few of the most interesting magical developments are planned," the Duke replied with what was definitely amusement now. "And how, exactly, does one go about accidentally awakening consciousness in root vegetables?"

The question hung in the air like smoke from a signal fire—impossible to ignore and likely to bring unwanted attention from all directions. Lin could feel dozens of eyes watching her, waiting for an answer that would either make sense of the impossible or confirm that they'd all witnessed something genuinely dangerous.

She glanced at her friends, seeing encouragement in Willi's steady gaze, mischief in Tobi's grin, and solid support in Greta's stance. Whatever happened next, they had her back. That knowledge steadied her enough to find her voice.

"I asked them for help," she said finally, the words feeling both inadequate and completely accurate. "There were bandits threatening Heinrich, and I could sense that the turnips weren't just objects—they had spirits, tiny sparks of potential consciousness. So I reached out through the laylines and asked if they wanted to become more than they were, to help protect someone who'd cared for them." She paused, studying the Duke's weathered face for signs of judgment or dismissal. "I didn't expect them to actually become conscious. I just... hoped they might be able to help somehow."

"And they said yes?"

Big Bertha rolled forward with what could only be called dignity, her voice rising in a complex melody that somehow conveyed determination, gratitude, and just a hint of sass that reminded Lin of Willi when someone questioned her cooking methods. Several other turnips joined in, creating a harmony that made Lin's chest warm with pride and terror in equal measure.

The song went on for nearly a minute, building in complexity and emotion until it sounded less like vegetable noises and more like an actual musical composition. Lin found herself swaying slightly to the rhythm, caught up in the turnips' joy despite the precarious situation.

"They're saying," Lin translated when the music finally faded, though the concepts were more emotional than verbal, "that consciousness is wonderful even though it's complicated, and they're grateful for the chance to think and choose and help others. Also, Big Bertha wants everyone to know that they're not dangerous, they're just enthusiastic about their new existence."

"Big Bertha?" the Duke asked, raising an eyebrow.

"The largest turnip. She seems to have appointed herself as their spokesperson." Lin gestured toward the impressively sized vegetable, who preened visibly at the attention. "She's very proud of her new name."

The Duke listened to this explanation with the focused attention of someone accustomed to evaluating complex testimony from unreliable witnesses. Around the courtyard, Lin could see people leaning forward, whispering among themselves, making calculations that probably involved the words 'forbidden magic' and 'Church investigation.'

"Your Grace," Lord Brennan tried again, his voice tight with barely controlled panic, "surely you can see the dangerous implications of uncontrolled consciousness manipulation—"

"I can see talking vegetables who just helped fight off bandits," the Duke interrupted mildly, "which seems like exactly the sort of innovation we should encourage, don't you think? Imagine the agricultural possibilities."

Lord Brennan looked like he was developing a migraine, which Lin felt was probably unfair since she was the one who'd accidentally created conscious vegetables in the first place.

"However," the Duke continued, and Lin felt her momentary relief begin to curdle like milk left too long in the sun, "this situation does require some... careful management. Too many ears and eyes for a proper discussion." He raised his voice to carry across the courtyard. "Everyone except Master Grauber, his escort, and the turnips themselves should return to their business. Now."

The dispersal wasn't immediate—Lin caught fragments of excited whispers about _conscious vegetables_ and _that little witch_ and _someone should send word to the capital immediately_—but gradually the courtyard emptied until only their small group remained with the Duke and a handful of guards who looked like they'd rather be anywhere else, possibly including a dungeon fighting trolls.

"Much better," the Duke said, settling onto a conveniently placed stone bench with the careful movements of someone whose joints had seen too many battles. "Privacy is essential for delicate negotiations. Now then, Miss Lin, was it? I find myself intensely curious about this magic of yours. Would you be willing to provide a small demonstration?"

Lin's heart hammered against her ribs like a caged bird trying to escape. Demonstrating her magic for the Duke of Königshafen felt like the sort of thing that could go spectacularly wrong in about seventeen different ways, but refusing probably wouldn't improve their situation.

"What did you have in mind, Your Grace?" she asked, proud that her voice only shook slightly.

"Something small, controlled, easily contained if necessary." The Duke's tone was reassuring, but Lin noticed he'd positioned himself within easy running distance of the courtyard's exit. "Perhaps one of the herbs in the kitchen garden?"

She looked around the courtyard and spotted a small herb garden along one wall—rosemary, thyme, and what looked like mint growing in neat, well-tended rows. Something simple and safe, she decided. Something that couldn't cause too much chaos if it went wrong.

"The rosemary?" she asked, gesturing toward the plants.

The Duke nodded permission.

Lin approached the herb garden with Willi and Greta flanking her like protective bookends, her blackthorn staff humming softly in her hands like a tuning fork struck against stone. She could hear Tobi maintaining a steady stream of whispered commentary behind her—something about "trust Lin to make gardening into a diplomatic incident"—which was both insulting and oddly comforting.

She knelt beside the largest rosemary plant and pressed her palm to the rich, dark soil, feeling for the tiny spark of life within. The earth was warm from the afternoon sun and rich with the scent of herbs and growing things, a combination that always made her feel more centered and capable.

The rosemary's consciousness was like finding a candle flame in a gentle breeze—warm, steady, content with its simple existence of growing toward sunlight and spreading aromatic leaves. Unlike the turnips, who had been restless and yearning for something more, the rosemary was perfectly happy with its life. Lin hesitated, suddenly uncertain about disturbing such peaceful contentment.

"It's not unhappy," she murmured, more to herself than to the watching audience. "It doesn't want change the way the turnips did."

"Can you awaken consciousness in something that doesn't desire it?" the Duke asked, leaning forward with obvious interest.

"I..." Lin paused, considering the question seriously. "I don't think so. Not ethically, anyway. Witchcraft is about partnership, not force. If the rosemary is content as it is, then awakening it would be like... like forcing someone to think about things they'd rather not consider."

"Fascinating. And you can sense this difference?"

"Every living thing has its own personality, its own desires and fears and contentment. Some plants long for growth and change, others prefer simplicity and peace." Lin kept her hand on the soil, maintaining contact with the rosemary's simple but real presence. "The turnips were lonely and bored and eager for something new. This rosemary is... satisfied."

"So consciousness awakening requires consent?" Willi asked, her voice carrying the tone she used when working through complex cooking techniques.

"More than consent," Lin replied, still focused on the plant's peaceful presence. "It requires desire. The plant has to want consciousness, has to be ready for the complexity and responsibility that comes with thinking and choosing."

She reached out through the laylines anyway, not to force awakening but to ask a gentle question: _Would you like to understand more about the world around you? To think about the humans who tend you and appreciate their care?_

The response came slowly, like honey flowing from a spoon—curiosity, mild interest, a willingness to try something new if it wouldn't be too overwhelming. The rosemary was content but not opposed to gentle expansion of its awareness.

Lin smiled and made the connection, offering partnership rather than commanding submission. The change was even more subtle than it had been with the turnips—the rosemary's leaves shimmered briefly with an inner light, and suddenly the plant's presence felt stronger, more defined, like the difference between hearing a whisper and hearing someone speak clearly.

"Hello," she whispered.

The rosemary's response came not in words but in a cascade of sensations and simple thoughts—warmth from the afternoon sunlight, satisfaction from recent watering, curiosity about the tall beings who moved through its world, gratitude for this new ability to perceive and understand. It was more sophisticated than the turnips' initial awareness but still fundamentally simple, content with gentle thoughts and peaceful observation.

"It's beautiful," Willi breathed, her eyes bright with wonder. "I can almost feel its contentment from here."

"Remarkable," the Duke murmured, leaning forward to study the plant more closely. "It's genuinely conscious? Not just animated or enhanced?"

"It's thinking," Lin confirmed, still maintaining contact with the rosemary's simple but real mind. "It wants to know why you're all so worried-feeling, and whether there's anything it can do to help. It's offering to share its knowledge about soil conditions and pest management if that would be useful."

The Duke was quiet for a long moment, his weathered face revealing nothing of his thoughts beyond obvious fascination. When he finally spoke, his voice carried the weight of someone making a decision that would reshape multiple lives.

"Master Grauber," he said, his attention shifting to Heinrich, who looked like he was contemplating whether spontaneous combustion might be an improvement over his current situation. "I have a proposition for you."

Heinrich made a sound that might have been agreement or might have been the last breath of a dying man.

"I'd like to purchase your entire crop. Not as produce—obviously that's no longer feasible—but as the first conscious vegetables in recorded history. Companions, agricultural consultants, living examples of a completely new form of existence." The Duke paused, studying Heinrich's face with obvious amusement. "Fifty gold per turnip."

The number hit the courtyard like a thunderclap. Heinrich's knees actually buckled, and he would have fallen if Greta hadn't moved quickly to steady him. Tobi let out a low whistle that somehow conveyed both admiration and disbelief, while Willi's hand flew to her mouth in shock.

Fifty gold per turnip meant over two thousand gold total—enough to buy Heinrich his own duchy, let alone secure his future for the rest of his life. It was the sort of fortune that most farmers couldn't even dream of, the kind of money that transformed entire families from peasants to nobility.

"Your Grace," Heinrich managed, his voice barely audible, "I... that's... are you certain?"

"Quite certain. They're unique, valuable, and likely to become increasingly important as word of their abilities spreads." The Duke's smile was genuinely warm. "Consider it an investment in agricultural innovation."

"However," he continued, and Lin felt her moment of wild hope begin to settle into something more complicated, "there are conditions."

Lin's stomach clenched. There were always conditions when adults started making generous offers to people who'd accidentally caused magical incidents.

"First, Miss Lin, I'd like you to remain here for a few days to help establish the turnips in their new role and to teach my court scholars whatever you're willing to share about this Witchcraft of yours." The Duke's eyes found hers, steady and measuring. "Second, when you return to your Academy, I'd appreciate if you kept me informed of your magical development. I have a feeling your innovations may prove... valuable to the kingdom."

It was generous, protective, and binding all at once. The Duke was offering to legitimize her magic, provide safety for the turnips, and secure Heinrich's fortune, but he was also ensuring that future magical developments would flow through his court before reaching the broader world. It was the kind of political maneuvering that her grandmother's stories had warned her about—help that came with invisible chains.

But looking at Big Bertha, who had rolled closer to listen to the negotiations with obvious intelligence, looking at Heinrich's face where hope and terror were still battling for dominance, looking at her friends who were ready to support whatever choice she made, Lin realized she didn't really have a choice. Not if she wanted to protect the turnips and help Heinrich.

"I accept, Your Grace."

"Excellent." The Duke clapped his hands together with obvious satisfaction. "We'll arrange quarters for you and your companions, and I'll have my staff begin preparing suitable accommodations for the turnips. This should prove to be a fascinating week."

The next few days passed in a whirlwind of controlled chaos that somehow felt exactly like what Lin's life had become. The turnips were relocated to a special section of the castle's kitchen gardens, where they immediately began offering unsolicited advice about soil composition, water scheduling, and pest management that had the head gardener alternating between delight and exasperation on an hourly basis.

"They keep trying to tell me how to do my job," Master Willem complained during the second morning, his weathered hands gesturing helplessly toward the turnip section. "And the terrible thing is, they're right about half the time."

"Only half?" Lin asked, trying not to smile.

"The other half, they're suggesting improvements I never would have thought of." Master Willem's expression shifted from frustration to grudging admiration. "That big one—Bertha?—she's developed a theory about companion planting that could revolutionize how we organize the entire garden. And the small ones keep pointing out pest problems before they become serious issues."

Big Bertha had indeed appointed herself as the official turnip spokesperson, spending long hours in serious consultation with the Duke's agricultural advisors. Her complex musical language somehow conveyed detailed information about optimal growing conditions, harvest timing, and crop rotation strategies that no human expert could match. She'd also taken on teaching responsibilities, helping the smaller turnips understand their new role and develop their individual specialties.

Lin often found herself serving as translator during these sessions, which led to some of the most surreal conversations of her life.

"Big Bertha wants to know," she explained to a bemused group of estate managers, "whether you've considered the emotional well-being of your apple trees. She thinks they might be lonely and suggests introducing some companion plants that could provide social interaction."

"Social interaction," repeated Master Edmund, the estate's chief agricultural advisor, in the tone of someone whose worldview was being systematically dismantled. "For apple trees."

"She's very concerned about plant psychology," Lin confirmed. "She believes that happy plants produce better crops, and that happiness requires community and purpose."

"She's not wrong," Master Willem admitted grudgingly. "I've noticed that the herbs near the turnip section are growing more vigorously than usual. They seem... livelier somehow."

Heinrich received his payment in a ceremony that attracted half the nobility in the duchy, transforming him overnight from struggling farmer to celebrity agricultural innovator. He seemed alternately overwhelmed by his sudden wealth and melancholy about saying goodbye to creatures he'd essentially raised from seeds.

"It's strange," he confided to Lin during their second evening at the castle, as they sat in the garden watching the turnips arrange themselves for their nightly communal singing session. "I never thought of them as individuals before, you know? They were just crops, valuable but not... personal. Now I feel like I'm sending my children away to live with strangers."

"They're not strangers anymore," Lin pointed out gently. "The gardeners here genuinely care about them, and the Duke sees their value beyond just novelty. They'll be safe and appreciated."

"I know. And the money will change everything for my family—my daughter can go to the Academy now if she wants, my wife can have the medical care she needs, we can expand the farm and hire help." Heinrich's smile was sad but genuine. "It's just... I'll miss their humming."

The turnips had developed increasingly complex musical arrangements during their stay at the castle, creating harmonies that served multiple purposes—communication, entertainment, and what could only be called emotional support for each other. Their evening concerts had become a highlight for many of the castle staff, who gathered to listen with expressions of wonder that never quite faded into routine.

Lin found herself shuttled between the castle's library, its magical workshops, and increasingly formal meetings with court scholars who wanted to document everything about Witchcraft techniques. Most of them approached her magic like academics dissecting a particularly interesting specimen, asking for formulas and measurements and theoretical frameworks that completely missed the point of partnership-based magic.

"But surely there must be some systematic approach," Master Cornelius insisted for what felt like the hundredth time, his quill poised over expensive parchment covered with failed attempts to codify Witchcraft. "Some formula for determining which creatures can be awakened and which cannot?"

Lin caught Willi's eye across the library table and saw her own frustration reflected there. Explaining Witchcraft to traditional mages was like trying to teach singing to people who insisted music should follow mathematical formulas rather than emotional truth.

"It doesn't work that way," Lin said patiently, though her patience was wearing thin. "Everything has a spirit, but not every spirit is ready for consciousness, and not every consciousness is suitable for awakening. It depends on the individual creature, the circumstances, the relationship between the witch and the potential partner, the state of the local laylines, the—"

"So it's completely unpredictable," Master Cornelius concluded with obvious disapproval.

"It's completely personal," Lin corrected for the dozenth time. "Every relationship is different. You can't codify relationships any more than you can write down the exact formula for friendship."

The scholar made another note that probably said something about "unscientific methodology" and "requires further standardization," which made Lin want to scream. Traditional mages seemed incapable of understanding that some forms of magic couldn't be reduced to formulas and recipes.

"Think of it like cooking," Willi suggested, apparently reading Lin's increasing frustration. "You can write down ingredients and techniques, but the actual skill comes from understanding how everything works together, how to adjust for variations, how to put your own personality into the final result."

"Exactly!" Lin said gratefully. "Witchcraft is about building relationships with living things. You can't standardize that any more than you can write instructions for making someone trust you."

Master Cornelius looked deeply unsatisfied with this explanation, but before he could protest further, Tobi spoke up from his corner where he'd been supposedly reading about historical magical innovations but had actually been eavesdropping on their conversation.

"You know what your problem is?" he said cheerfully to the assembled scholars. "You're trying to turn magic into bureaucracy. Lin's magic works because she treats plants like people, not because she follows rules about plant-treating procedures."

"Magic requires structure and regulation," Master Cornelius protested. "Without systematic approaches, magical practice becomes chaos and accident."

"Sometimes chaos and accident create something beautiful," Greta observed from her position near the window, where she'd been apparently watching the courtyard but obviously listening to their discussion. "The best adventures rarely go according to plan."

"Adventures," Master Cornelius said with the disdain of someone who'd spent his entire life in libraries and laboratories, "are precisely what we seek to avoid in controlled magical research."

"Then you're missing the point of magic entirely," Lin said with sudden clarity. "Magic isn't about control. It's about connection. It's about being open to possibilities you never imagined, building relationships with beings you never expected to meet, discovering abilities you didn't know you had." She gestured toward the window, beyond which the turnips' evening concert was beginning. "If I'd tried to control what happened with the turnips, if I'd followed formulas and procedures and systematic approaches, we never would have discovered what they could become."

The conversation continued for another hour, but Lin could tell she wasn't making real progress with the court scholars. They were too invested in their traditional approaches, too committed to the idea that magic should be predictable and controllable, to truly understand Witchcraft's partnership-based philosophy.

Later that evening, she escaped the formal consultations to visit the turnips in their new garden. She found them arranged in their familiar circle, their voices harmonizing in a song that somehow conveyed both contentment and homesickness, gratitude and uncertainty about the future.

"How are you settling in?" she asked, settling cross-legged on the soft grass beside Big Bertha.

The responses came in a cascade of overlapping emotions and simple concepts. They loved their new home, especially the rich soil and careful tending from the castle's gardeners. They were proud of their role as agricultural consultants and enjoyed sharing their knowledge with human experts who actually listened to their advice. But they also missed the simplicity of their life with Heinrich, missed the close camaraderie of the wagon journey, missed the uncomplicated purpose of just growing and being ready for harvest.

Most of all, they missed Lin herself.

"You're the one who gave us consciousness," Big Bertha explained in her complex musical language. "Without you, we're just talking vegetables giving agricultural advice. With you, we're part of something bigger, something meaningful."

The conversation left Lin with a hollow feeling in her chest that she couldn't quite shake. The turnips were safe, purposeful, and valued, but they were also isolated from the witch who'd awakened them and the farmer who'd raised them. She'd solved the immediate crisis but created a new form of loneliness in the process.

"I'll visit whenever I can," she promised, though she wasn't sure how realistic that would be once she returned to Academy life. "And I'll keep learning about consciousness awakening, keep trying to understand what we've started together."

"Will you awaken others?" asked one of the smaller turnips, its voice carrying wistful hope.

"I..." Lin paused, considering the question seriously. "I don't know. It depends on whether I find others who want consciousness as much as you did, whether the circumstances are right, whether I can do it safely." She looked around at the circle of vegetables who had become so much more than their original nature. "What do you think? Should I keep awakening consciousness in other plants?"

The discussion that followed was one of the most philosophical conversations Lin had ever participated in, with the turnips debating the ethics and implications of consciousness awakening with surprising sophistication. They ultimately concluded that consciousness was a gift worth sharing, but only with creatures who truly desired it and in circumstances where the newly awakened beings would be supported and valued.

"Consciousness without community is suffering," Big Bertha observed with the wisdom of someone who'd experienced both states. "But consciousness with purpose and friendship is joy beyond description."

On her final morning at the castle, Duke Wilhelm summoned her to his private study for a conversation that felt more like a friendly chat between equals than a formal audience. The room was cozy despite its grandeur, filled with well-used books, comfortable furniture, and afternoon sunlight that made everything feel warm and welcoming.

"How are you finding court life, Miss Lin?"

"Educational, Your Grace. Also exhausting. I'm not certain I'm cut out for this much formal politeness." Lin settled into the offered chair with relief, grateful for the chance to speak honestly. "Everyone here is very kind, but they're also very... careful. Every conversation feels like a negotiation."

The Duke's smile was warmer than any expression she'd seen from him in the public courtyard. "Few people are naturally suited to court politics, which is why most of us learn to reserve our authentic selves for special occasions and trusted company. Tell me, what are your plans when you return to Eisenstadt?"

"Continue my studies, I suppose. Try to understand this magic better, learn to control it properly, avoid accidentally awakening anything too dangerous." Lin paused, considering whether complete honesty was wise in this context, then decided the Duke had earned her trust. "Also figure out how to help people without creating more problems than I solve. The turnips worked out well, but what if next time I awaken something that doesn't want consciousness? Or something that uses consciousness for harmful purposes?"

"An admirable concern. May I offer some advice from someone who's spent considerable time managing the consequences of other people's innovations?"

Lin nodded eagerly.

"Don't try to solve everything at once. Magic that can awaken consciousness in vegetables could revolutionize agriculture, transform the relationship between humans and nature, spark religious wars, or create new forms of slavery depending on how it's understood and applied." The Duke's voice carried the weight of someone who'd seen good intentions go catastrophically wrong. "Focus on learning control first, understanding second, and changing the world third."

"That sounds reasonable in theory," Lin admitted. "But what happens when situations arise where people need help immediately? What if I encounter someone like Heinrich again, where waiting to fully understand my magic might mean watching someone suffer?"

"Then you'll have to make difficult choices with incomplete information, just like every leader and innovator before you." The Duke's expression grew more serious. "But the key is building a support network of people you trust to help guide those choices. Your friends seem remarkably capable in that regard."

Lin smiled at the mention of her companions. "They are. I don't think I could navigate any of this without them."

"Good. Because word of your abilities will spread, Miss Lin. People will seek you out—some to learn from you, others to use you, still others to stop you from what they see as dangerous innovation." The Duke leaned forward, his gray eyes intense. "Make sure you're surrounded by people you trust when that happens. Court politics can be navigated safely, but only with reliable allies who have your genuine interests at heart."

"What about you, Your Grace? Are you a reliable ally, or someone who wants to use my abilities for political advantage?"

The directness of the question seemed to surprise the Duke, but after a moment he laughed—genuine amusement that transformed his weathered face. "Both, I suspect. I believe your innovations could benefit the kingdom, which means supporting your development serves my political interests. But I also find myself genuinely concerned about your wellbeing, which means I want to see you succeed for your own sake." He paused, studying her face carefully. "The question is whether you can accept help that comes with political obligations."

Lin considered this seriously. The Duke's honesty was refreshing after days of careful diplomatic language, and his offer felt more balanced than exploitative. "As long as the obligations don't prevent me from helping people or force me to use my magic in ways that feel wrong, I think I can work with political complexity."

"Fair enough. In that case, let me be clear about my expectations." The Duke's tone became more formal. "I want regular reports on your magical development, advance notice of any significant innovations or discoveries, and the opportunity to study any new techniques you develop before they're shared more broadly. In exchange, you'll have my protection, financial support for your studies, and access to resources that could accelerate your learning."

"And if I discover something that I believe should be shared immediately with everyone, regardless of political implications?"

"Then we'll negotiate that situation when it arises, hopefully with wisdom and mutual respect." The Duke's smile returned. "I'm not interested in controlling you, Miss Lin. I'm interested in ensuring that your innovations benefit the kingdom rather than destroying it through uncontrolled distribution."

The conversation stayed with Lin during the journey back to Eisenstadt, mixing with the memory of Big Bertha's musical farewell and Heinrich's tearful gratitude and the weight of gold in her travel purse—payment from the Duke for her consulting services, enough to cover Academy fees for several semesters.

"Copper for your thoughts?" Willi asked as their wagon rolled through the familiar countryside toward home.

"Just thinking about responsibility," Lin replied, watching the autumn landscape roll past. "And how solving one problem always seems to create three new ones."

"That's the nature of change," Greta observed from her position beside the wagon driver. "Every improvement disrupts something else, every innovation creates new challenges."

"The trick," Tobi added with a grin that was only slightly forced, "is making sure the new problems are more interesting than the old ones."

"Are you saying conscious vegetables are more interesting than bandits?" Lin asked with amusement.

"Definitely. Bandits are boring—they always want the same things and use the same methods. Conscious vegetables might want anything. They might decide to organize a farmers' union, or compose epic poetry, or develop new agricultural technologies, or..." Tobi's expression brightened with possibility. "Actually, now I'm really curious about what they'll accomplish in the next few years."

"We should visit them periodically," Willi suggested. "Keep in touch, see how they're developing, maybe learn from their innovations."

"I'd like that," Lin said, surprised by how much the idea appealed to her. "It would be nice to maintain the relationship rather than just moving on to the next crisis."

"Plus," Greta added with practical consideration, "the Duke seems like a useful ally to cultivate. Having noble protection could be valuable when Lin's magic inevitably causes the next impossible situation."

Lin considered this as Eisenstadt's walls appeared on the horizon, the familiar sight of home mixed with uncertainty about what waited for them there. Professor Aldrich would want a full report on their journey, the Adventurer's Guild would expect an accounting of their contract completion, and somewhere in the city were the routine concerns of Academy life that suddenly felt both comforting and impossibly distant.

But first, she realized with growing anticipation, there would be her own small room with its window overlooking the Academy gardens, Willi's cooking that turned simple ingredients into comfort food, Tobi's stories that made ordinary adventures sound legendary, and Greta's steady presence that made even uncertain futures feel manageable.

"You know what I'm looking forward to most?" she asked as their wagon approached the city gates.

"A hot bath?" Willi suggested.

"Clean clothes?" Greta offered.

"A tavern that serves something stronger than castle wine?" Tobi added hopefully.

"All of those," Lin agreed with a laugh. "But mostly just being together without having to worry about political implications or magical demonstrations or whether we're accidentally violating divine natural order." She paused, then added with growing excitement, "Though I am curious about what other plants around the Academy might be interested in consciousness awakening."

Her friends groaned in unison.

"Lin," Willi said with the patient tone of someone explaining something obvious to a small child, "please tell me you're not planning to turn our return home into another magical incident."

"I'm not planning anything," Lin protested with complete honesty. "I never plan magical incidents. They just... happen."

"That," Greta observed dryly, "is exactly what we're worried about."
