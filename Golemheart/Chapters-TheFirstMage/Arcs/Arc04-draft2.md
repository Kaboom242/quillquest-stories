### Leyline Connection Integration:
Each chapter now includes discovery that runic syntax encodes harmonic frequencies matching leyline node resonances. Modular runic arrays can be tuned as stabilizing dampers for fracturing nodes. This knowledge makes Lin's research essential for the leyline crisis but threatens institutional control, explaining Academy interest and Church fear. Sets up Arc 05 where Church blocks stabilization efforts to maintain crisis for political control.
