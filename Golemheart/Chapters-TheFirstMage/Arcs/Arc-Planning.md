### The Three Pillars of Supernatural Power
- **Holy Power**: Church of the Luminous Light - divine magic through faith, prayer, blessing
- **Academic Magic**: Scientific approach - controlled spells through theory, components, precise methodology  
- **Witchcraft**: Ancient traditions - partnership with natural forces, spirits, seasonal cycles

Lin's journey represents the rediscovery and revolutionizing of the third pillar.

### Revolutionary Innovations:
- **Hybrid Runic Scripts**: Combining multiple cultural traditions into more powerful unified system
- **Threadcraft Integration**: Using her textile magic to "weave" runic patterns into fabric and other materials

- **The Emergence and Catastrophe**: A Demon Lord rises from the fracture, erects a fortress, and plunges the realm into war. The Church and the Academy are outmatched, and the tide turns in favor of the abyss.
