# Chapter Six: The Great Turnip Catastrophe of Königshafen

The morning sun painted Königshafen's walls gold in the distance, but Heinrich Grauber saw only his approaching doom. His precious turnips had spent the night arranging themselves into increasingly complex formations, and now they hummed in harmony as the wagon rolled toward the city gates. What had once been his pride—forty-three premium Purple Heart turnips worth more than most farmers saw in a year—had become his nightmare.

"They're practicing," he said, his voice hollow with despair. "Listen to them. They're rehearsing something."

Lin shifted beside him on the wagon seat, her blackthorn staff warm against her palm. The turnips' song tugged at something deep in her chest, and she could almost understand the words they were weaving together. Almost, but not quite, which somehow made it worse.

"Maybe they're just excited," she offered, though her own stomach churned with dread.

Heinrich's laugh held no humor. "Excited. Yes, that's exactly what I need—excited magical vegetables meeting Duke Wilhelm. Do you know what happens to farmers accused of dark magic, Lin? They don't just lose their crops. They lose everything. Their land, their families, their lives."

Behind them, Greta's armor clinked as she adjusted her position in the saddle. "Come now, Heinrich. Surely Duke Wilhelm is a reasonable man. When he sees the artistic merit of your turnips' performance—"

"Artistic merit?" Heinrich's voice cracked. "Greta, these aren't street performers. They're food that gained consciousness because our witch here doesn't know her own strength. There's a word for that kind of magic, and it starts with 'forbidden.'"

Lin flinched. She'd been trying not to think about the implications of what she'd done, but Heinrich's fear forced her to face the truth. She'd awakened consciousness in living things without permission, without understanding, without considering the consequences. In some kingdoms, that was grounds for burning.

Tobi appeared alongside the wagon, having scouted ahead to the city gates. His usual grin was strained at the edges. "Small problem," he announced. "There's a crowd gathering to watch us approach. Word about singing vegetables travels fast, apparently."

"How big a crowd?" Willi asked, though her voice suggested she already knew the answer wouldn't be good.

"Let's just say if we were actual performers, we'd be very flattered by the turnout."

Lin's heart sank as they crested the small hill before Königshafen's main gate. A substantial group had indeed gathered—merchants abandoning their stalls, children pressing against their parents' legs for a better view, and worst of all, city guards forming a distinctly official-looking formation near the gate itself.

The turnips, sensing an audience, began to warm up with scales.

"Oh no," Heinrich breathed. "Oh no, oh no, oh no."

Big Bertha, the largest and most dramatically inclined of the turnips, rolled to the front of the wagon bed and delivered what could only be called a greeting to the assembled crowd. Her voice carried clearly across the morning air, a rich contralto that would have been impressive coming from a trained singer, let alone a root vegetable.

The crowd's reaction was immediate and varied. Children clapped with delight, merchants scratched their heads in bewilderment, and the guards gripped their spears with the particular tension of men facing something their training hadn't covered.

Sergeant Klaus Hartmann had been guarding Königshafen's gates for fifteen years. He'd seen smugglers, drunks, escaped livestock, religious fanatics, and once, memorably, a man claiming to be the reincarnation of Emperor Charlemagne. But he had never seen a wagon full of singing vegetables, and his practical mind was struggling to categorize the threat level.

"Halt!" he called out, his voice carrying the authority of the Duke's commission. "State your business in Königshafen!"

Heinrich's mouth opened and closed soundlessly. Lin could see his hands shaking on the reins, could feel the weight of his terror pressing down on them all like a physical thing. In that moment, she realized that this wasn't just about delivering turnips anymore. This was about whether her magic would destroy the life of a good man who'd done nothing wrong except trust her.

The decision crystallized in her mind with sudden clarity.

"We're entertainers," she called out, standing up in the wagon seat with more confidence than she felt. "The Königshafen Purple Heart Turnip Performance Troupe, here for Duke Wilhelm's harvest festival."

Sergeant Hartmann's weathered face expressed the kind of skepticism that came from years of dealing with creative explanations. "Entertainers. With turnips."

"Revolutionary agricultural theater," Greta added, her voice ringing with the conviction of someone who'd decided to believe their own nonsense. "The artistic boundaries between performer and performance have been... transcended."

Big Bertha, apparently understanding that this was her audition, launched into what sounded like a formal introduction. Her voice soared and dipped with theatrical precision, and the other turnips provided accompaniment that was both musically complex and utterly surreal.

The crowd's murmur shifted from confusion to genuine interest. Children began swaying to the rhythm, and Lin caught sight of a few adults nodding appreciatively at the turnips' harmonic arrangements.

Sergeant Hartmann looked from the performing vegetables to Lin's obviously magical staff to Heinrich's expression of barely contained panic. "And you're their... manager?"

"I'm their friend," Lin said simply, and was surprised to realize it was true. These weren't just Heinrich's crop anymore, weren't just proof of her magical abilities. They were individuals with their own personalities and desires, and she was responsible for protecting them as much as they were transforming her.

The sergeant's hand hovered near his sword hilt. "There've been reports of unusual magic in the area. The Duke's been asking questions about anyone claiming to practice... old arts."

Lin felt her friends tense behind her, ready to fight or flee depending on what happened next. The turnips had gone quiet, Big Bertha rolling closer to the front of the wagon as if sensing the danger.

"The only art here," Lin said carefully, "is the art of friendship. Of listening to what others need instead of commanding what we want. If that's magic, then yes, I suppose we're magical."

For a long moment, the only sound was the rustle of wind through the crowd and the distant calls of merchants in the city beyond. Then Captain Sarah Weber, having arrived to investigate the commotion, pushed through the assembled guards.

Captain Weber had earned her position through competence, pragmatism, and an unshakeable ability to find workable solutions to impossible problems. She took one look at the wagon full of singing turnips, at Lin's earnest face and Heinrich's obvious terror, and made a decision that would be talked about in taverns for months to come.

"Entertainers, you said?" she asked briskly.

"Yes, ma'am," Lin replied.

"And you're here for the Duke's harvest festival?"

"That's correct."

Captain Weber studied the turnips, who had begun what appeared to be a soft, hopeful melody. "The Duke's been complaining that this year's entertainment lacks innovation. Something about 'the same tired juggling acts and tone-deaf minstrels.'" She paused, watching Big Bertha attempt what looked suspiciously like a curtsy. "I think he'll find your act... distinctive."

She waved them through the gate, but her voice carried clearly as they passed. "Fair warning—if your turnips cause any trouble, it's on your heads. And I mean that literally."

As their wagon rolled into Königshafen proper, Lin felt the weight of what they'd just accomplished and what lay ahead. They'd made it past the guards, but now they had to actually deliver conscious, opinionated vegetables to a Duke's harvest festival without causing a riot.

The streets bustled with festival preparations, and everywhere they went, their wagon drew stares and pointing fingers. The turnips, energized by their successful audition, began providing what sounded like commentary on the city's architecture, the quality of other merchants' produce, and the fashion choices of passing nobles.

Heinrich drove in grim silence, his knuckles white on the reins. "This is insane," he muttered. "We're taking singing vegetables to meet the Duke. How did my life become a tavern song?"

"Not just any tavern song," Tobi said cheerfully, riding alongside with his lute now out and ready. "A really good tavern song. The kind people will still be singing years from now."

"That's not helping," Heinrich replied.

Willi guided her horse closer to the wagon. "Heinrich, look at them," she said gently, nodding toward the turnips. "Really look. They're not trying to cause trouble. They're trying to belong."

Lin followed Willi's gaze and realized she was right. The turnips weren't performing out of mischief or chaos—they were doing their best to fit into a world that had suddenly become much larger and more complex than the simple existence they'd known in Heinrich's fields. They were trying to be what they thought humans wanted them to be.

"They're scared too," she said softly. "They don't understand this world any better than we understand what they've become."

The revelation shifted something in Heinrich's posture. His grip on the reins relaxed slightly, and when Big Bertha rolled closer to the front of the wagon, he didn't flinch away.

"All right," he said quietly. "All right. We're all in this together, then. Humans and turnips and whatever comes next."

The castle loomed ahead, its towers flying festival banners that snapped in the autumn breeze. The courtyard beyond the main gate was a carefully organized chaos of merchants, servants, and nobility preparing for Duke Wilhelm's harvest celebration. Long tables displayed the finest produce from across the kingdom, while workers hung garlands and arranged displays with the precision of military operations.

It was exactly the kind of formal, traditional setting where conscious vegetables could cause maximum mayhem.

"Remember," Lin whispered to the turnips as they approached the merchant's area, "we're sophisticated performers now. Professional. Dignified."

Big Bertha's response sounded suspiciously like laughter.

They'd barely begun unloading when the disaster Lin had been dreading finally struck. A harried servant, arms full of prize-winning squash, stumbled over a loose cobblestone and sent vegetables flying in a cascade of orange and green.

The sight of fellow produce in distress triggered something primal in the turnips. With a collective cry that sounded like a battle hymn crossed with a rescue operation, forty-three Purple Heart turnips launched themselves from the wagon in pursuit of the scattered squash.

The courtyard erupted.

Heinrich's turnips rolled, bounced, and ricocheted off walls and people with the determination of tiny purple cannonballs. Big Bertha led the charge, her voice raised in what sounded like commands to her fellow rescue workers. Smaller turnips spread out in formation, corralling escaped butternut squash and wayward pumpkins with military precision.

Servants dove for cover behind tables. Merchants snatched their most valuable produce to safety. A cart of apples overturned as its owner leaped clear of the turnip cavalry, sending fruit rolling in all directions and doubling the chaos.

In the center of it all stood Duke Wilhelm von Königshafen himself, a tall man with an impressive gray beard and the kind of voice that could command armies. He watched the vegetable stampede with the expression of someone whose worldview was undergoing rapid and fundamental revision.

"WHAT," he roared in a voice that echoed off the castle walls, "IN THE NAME OF ALL THE SAINTS, IS HAPPENING IN MY COURTYARD?"

Lin jumped down from the wagon, staff in hand, and tried to project an authority she didn't feel. "Your Grace! Allow me to present the Königshafen Purple Heart Turnip Performance Troupe!"

The Duke's eyes fixed on her with the intensity of a hunting hawk. "Performance troupe?"

Around them, the turnip rescue operation continued with enthusiastic determination. Big Bertha had cornered a particularly large pumpkin and was apparently trying to convince it to roll to safety, while a chorus of smaller turnips provided what sounded like encouragement or possibly tactical advice.

"They're very committed to their art," Lin said desperately.

"Their art," the Duke repeated slowly, watching a turnip successfully guide a lost butternut squash back toward its proper display, "appears to involve vegetable rescue operations."

"Community outreach," Greta said quickly, appearing at Lin's shoulder with her armor gleaming and her sword conspicuously sheathed. "The true artist serves society as well as beauty."

A turnip rolled past them, still herding a recalcitrant cabbage while humming what sounded like a work song. The Duke followed its progress with the fascination of a scholar observing a new species.

"Is that turnip," he asked slowly, "singing while it works?"

"They believe in the dignity of labor," Lin said, which was technically true and seemed like the safest answer.

Big Bertha chose that moment to complete her pumpkin rescue mission and roll directly to the Duke's feet. She looked up at him—or at least oriented her stem in his direction—and launched into what could only be described as a formal introduction, complete with what Lin suspected were attempts at courtly protocol.

The Duke stared down at the turnip for a long, dangerous moment. Lin's hand tightened on her staff, and she could feel her friends preparing for the worst. Heinrich stood frozen by his wagon, his face the color of old parchment.

Then something extraordinary happened.

Duke Wilhelm von Königshafen, sovereign lord of one of the most prosperous duchies in the realm, defender of the eastern marches, and patron of the arts, began to smile.

It started small, just a twitch at the corner of his mouth as he watched Big Bertha's earnest performance. Then it grew as he looked around his courtyard, where turnips were still industriously returning lost vegetables to their proper places while maintaining perfect pitch in their working songs.

"In thirty years," he said slowly, his voice growing stronger with each word, "of harvest festivals, trade negotiations, and diplomatic receptions..." He paused, watching another turnip attempt what appeared to be a respectful bow. "I have never seen vegetables with better manners than half my court."

The laughter started as a rumble in his chest, then grew until it boomed across the courtyard. "Singing turnips! Performing vegetables! By God's teeth, this is exactly what this kingdom needs!"

The relief that flooded through Lin was so intense she nearly collapsed. Around the courtyard, servants began emerging from their hiding places, some even applauding as the turnips finished their rescue mission and arranged themselves in neat rows for what appeared to be a closing number.

"Your Grace is too kind," Heinrich managed, his voice barely a whisper.

"Nonsense!" The Duke beamed at them all. "This is innovation! This is artistry! This is..." He paused, his expression growing more thoughtful as he studied Lin's staff and the subtle glow that surrounded the turnips. "This is magic, isn't it? Real magic."

Lin felt the moment balance on a knife's edge. Everything they'd built, all the safety they'd found in calling themselves entertainers, hung on her next words.

"Yes," she said simply. "The old kind. The kind that makes friends instead of servants."

The Duke nodded slowly, his eyes never leaving her face. "There have been rumors. Reports of a young woman who can wake sleeping magic in growing things. They call her..." He smiled. "They call her the First Witch."

Lin felt her friends tense, ready to fight or flee. The turnips had gone quiet, Big Bertha rolling closer as if sensing the importance of the moment.

"Magic is changing," Lin said carefully. "The old ways are waking up. Plants want to be more than just food or decoration. They want to participate, to contribute, to be part of something larger than themselves." She gestured to the turnips, who were listening with rapt attention. "They're not my subjects or my creations. They're my friends."

Duke Wilhelm was quiet for a long moment, studying the orderly rows of turnips, the cleaned-up courtyard, the faces of Lin's companions. When he spoke again, his voice carried a weight that made everyone lean forward to listen.

"My kingdom has always prided itself on progress," he said slowly. "On being at the forefront of innovation, whether in agriculture, trade, or the arts. It seems to me that this..." He gestured to encompass the turnips, Lin's staff, and the lingering magic in the air. "This represents the next step in that progress."

Lin's heart hammered against her ribs. "Your Grace?"

"Your turnip troupe shall have the place of honor at tomorrow's festival," the Duke declared. "But I have one condition." His eyes met Lin's with unmistakable intention. "I want to see what other plants you can wake. For the advancement of knowledge, you understand. And because I suspect my kingdom could use more citizens like these."

He gestured to the turnips, who had begun what sounded like a victory celebration song, their voices weaving together in harmonies that made the hair on Lin's arms stand up with the beauty of it.

As Duke Wilhelm walked away, leaving Lin standing in a courtyard full of singing vegetables and scattered evidence of their successful chaos, she realized that their simple delivery mission had become something far more significant. They weren't just bringing produce to market anymore—they were introducing an entirely new kind of magic to the world.

Big Bertha rolled up beside her and delivered what sounded like a request for better dressing rooms and possibly catering for tomorrow's performance.

"Well," Tobi said, his grin now genuine and wide, "that wasn't terrifying at all. Though I'm pretty sure we're about to become either very famous or very dead."

Heinrich, still pale but no longer looking like a man facing execution, managed a shaky laugh. "At this point, I'm willing to take either one over explaining to my mother why I lost the family farm to singing vegetables."

Lin looked at her friends, at the turnips who were now apparently planning their setlist for tomorrow's festival, and at the castle that had become the stage for whatever came next. The laylines beneath her feet hummed with possibility, and for the first time since awakening her first plant, she felt ready to discover what else her magic could do.

"Both," she said, gripping her Blackthorn staff with new determination. "We're probably going to be both. And somehow, that doesn't scare me anymore."

Big Bertha's response sounded suspiciously like applause.
