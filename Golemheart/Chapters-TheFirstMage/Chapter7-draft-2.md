# Chapter Seven: The Price of Wonder

Duke Wilhelm von Königshafen's smile faded as he processed what he was witnessing. The courtyard had been transformed into a battlefield of rolling vegetables, but not by any magic he recognized. The turnips moved with purpose, with intelligence, with what appeared to be genuine concern for their fellow produce. That changed everything.

"Clear the courtyard," he commanded, his voice carrying the authority of three decades of rule. "Everyone except the turnip handlers and their escort."

Servants and merchants scattered, but Lin caught the whispered conversations as they fled. _Forbidden magic. Dark arts. Someone should notify the Church._ Her stomach clenched with the realization that their problems were just beginning.

"Your Grace," Heinrich began, his voice shaking, "I can explain—"

"I'm sure you can." The Duke's tone remained carefully neutral as he studied Big Bertha, who had positioned herself protectively in front of the other turnips. "But first, I want to understand exactly what we're dealing with. Miss..." He looked expectantly at Lin.

"Lin Xiu, Your Grace." She gripped her blackthorn staff tighter, feeling the warm pulse of the runes against her palm. "The responsibility for this is mine."

"Responsibility for what, precisely?"

The question hung in the air like a sword waiting to fall. Lin could lie, could claim the turnips had always been magical, could deflect blame onto some convenient scapegoat. But looking at Heinrich's terrified face, at her friends' tense postures, at the turnips who trusted her completely, she knew there was only one answer that wouldn't destroy everything she'd started to build.

"For awakening consciousness in living vegetables without understanding the consequences, Your Grace."

The Duke's gray eyes sharpened. "Awakening consciousness. That's a very specific phrase, young lady. Where did you learn such magic?"

"I didn't learn it, Your Grace. I created it." Lin's voice grew steadier as she spoke the truth aloud for the first time. "Based on my grandmother's stories about the spirits that live in everything. I call it Witchcraft."

Behind the Duke, Lord Aldric sucked in a sharp breath. "Your Grace, this is precisely what the Church has warned about. Unregulated magical experimentation that violates the natural order—"

"Lord Aldric." The Duke's voice carried a warning. "I'll hear the girl's full explanation before I make any judgments."

Lin felt Greta move closer, ready to fight if necessary, and drew strength from her friend's loyalty. "The turnips were lonely, Your Grace. They felt isolated, purposeless. I reached out to them as my grandmother taught me—with respect, with partnership instead of domination. I never intended for this to happen, but I can't say I regret it now that I've seen who they really are."

As if to underscore her point, Big Bertha rolled forward and launched into what sounded like an impassioned speech. Her voice rose and fell with musical precision, and even without understanding the words, the emotion was unmistakable—gratitude, determination, and a fierce protective love for her fellow turnips.

Duke Wilhelm listened to the entire performance with the focused attention of a man accustomed to weighing complex evidence. When Big Bertha finished, he was quiet for a long moment.

"Thirty years ago," he said finally, "I fought alongside a battle-mage who could animate stone gargoyles to defend our walls. The magic was clean, controlled, effective—and the creatures it created were empty shells with no thoughts beyond their programming." He gestured toward the turnips. "These vegetables have personalities. They make choices. They care about each other." His gaze fixed on Lin. "That's not standard animation magic, is it?"

"No, Your Grace. It's something entirely new."

"And entirely unauthorized," Lord Aldric interjected. "Your Grace, the Church's position on consciousness manipulation is very clear. Such practices border on necromancy—"

"These turnips are not undead, Aldric," the Duke said sharply. "They're more alive than they were before, not less. The theological implications are hardly straightforward."

Lin felt a flicker of hope, but it died when she saw the calculating look that crossed the Duke's face. She'd seen that expression before, in the Academy's administrative offices when officials discussed her grandmother's "unorthodox" teachings. It was the look of someone trying to determine how much trouble she was worth.

"However," the Duke continued, "the political implications are considerable. Word of this will spread, and there will be questions. From the Church, from other nobles, from the King himself. I need to understand exactly what you've done and whether you can control it."

"I'm still learning to control it, Your Grace," Lin admitted. "But I can demonstrate—"

"Not here." The Duke cut her off. "Too many eyes, too many ears. We'll continue this discussion privately." He turned to Heinrich. "Master Grauber, your original purpose here was to sell these turnips at my harvest festival?"

"Yes, Your Grace. Königshafen Purple Hearts, the finest in the kingdom." Heinrich's voice cracked slightly. "Though I'm not sure anyone will believe they're still just vegetables after this."

"Quite the understatement." Duke Wilhelm studied the turnips, who had arranged themselves in neat rows and were humming softly. "The question is whether anyone will be willing to purchase conscious beings as festival produce."

Lin's heart sank. She'd been so focused on getting the turnips to safety that she hadn't considered the impossibility of selling them. Who would buy a thinking, feeling creature to eat? And without that sale, Heinrich would lose everything—his investment, his livelihood, possibly his freedom if the authorities decided to pursue charges.

"Your Grace," she said desperately, "the fault is mine. Heinrich did nothing wrong. If there are consequences—"

"There are always consequences, Miss Lin." The Duke's voice was not unkind, but it was firm. "The question is how to manage them. Follow me."

They were escorted not to the castle's great hall but to a small solar overlooking the private gardens. Here, away from the crowds and gossip, Duke Wilhelm revealed a side of himself that Lin hadn't expected—the careful politician who had survived three decades of court intrigue.

"Sit," he commanded, gesturing to chairs arranged around a small table. "We have much to discuss and little time before rumors begin to take on lives of their own."

Tobi closed the door behind them and took up a position near the window, his usual grin replaced by watchful tension. Willi conjured a small flame to warm her hands—a nervous habit Lin had noticed during their travels. Greta remained standing, her hand resting on her sword hilt.

"First question," the Duke began, settling heavily into his chair. "Miss Lin, how many people know about your abilities?"

"Just our party, Your Grace. And Professor Aldrich at the Royal Academy, though he doesn't know about the awakening specifically."

"Good. That limits the immediate spread of information. Second question—can you reverse what you've done to the turnips?"

Lin's breath caught. "I... I don't know. I've never tried. But Your Grace, they're not damaged or cursed. They're just... more than they were."

"More than they were," the Duke repeated. "And what happens when other mages try to replicate your work? When every farmer in the kingdom demands conscious crops? When the Church declares awakened vegetables an abomination?"

The questions hit like physical blows. Lin had been so focused on the immediate problems that she hadn't considered the broader implications. Her magic could revolutionize agriculture, transform society, or spark religious war—and she had no idea which.

"I don't know," she whispered.

"Exactly." Duke Wilhelm leaned forward. "You've stumbled onto something that could change the world, and you have no plan for managing that change. That makes you dangerous, Miss Lin. Not evil, but dangerous nonetheless."

Heinrich spoke up, his voice barely audible. "What about my turnips, Your Grace? What happens to them?"

"That depends on several factors. Miss Lin, I want you to demonstrate this Witchcraft of yours, but carefully. Show me something small, controlled, reversible if necessary."

Lin looked around the solar, her mind racing. There was a small potted herb on the windowsill—rosemary, from the scent. Something simple, safe, easily contained.

She approached the plant with careful steps, her blackthorn staff humming softly in her hands. "May I?"

The Duke nodded.

Lin knelt beside the pot and pressed her palm to the soil, feeling for the tiny life within. The rosemary's consciousness was like a small, bright spark—uncomplicated and content. She reached out gently, offering partnership rather than commanding obedience.

The change was subtle but unmistakable. The rosemary's leaves shimmered briefly, and suddenly the plant's presence felt stronger, more aware. It rustled without any wind, and Lin could sense its curiosity about the strangers in the room.

"Hello," she whispered.

The rosemary's response came not in words but in images—sunlight, water, the pleasure of growing toward the light. Simple thoughts from a simple mind, but undeniably real.

Duke Wilhelm watched this exchange with the intensity of a scholar observing a new species. "Can it understand complex concepts?"

Lin asked the rosemary about the room, the people, the situation. The responses were basic—warm, safe, interesting—but showed clear comprehension.

"To some degree, Your Grace. It's not human intelligence, but it's genuine awareness."

"And can you reverse the process?"

This was the question Lin had been dreading. She reached out to the rosemary again, this time asking if it wanted to return to its previous state of simple existence. The plant's response was immediate and emphatic—it preferred consciousness, preferred the ability to think and choose and communicate.

"It doesn't want to go back, Your Grace."

"I see." The Duke was quiet for several minutes, his fingers steepled as he considered the implications. Finally, he spoke. "Here's what we're going to do. The turnips cannot be sold as produce—that much is clear. But they can be sold as something else entirely."

Lin's heart leaped with hope. "What do you mean, Your Grace?"

"Companions. Advisors. Agricultural consultants. The first of their kind in the kingdom." The Duke's eyes gleamed with the same calculating look Lin had seen earlier, but now she recognized it as opportunity rather than threat. "I'll purchase the entire crop for fifty gold per turnip, not as food but as permanent residents of my castle."

Heinrich's gasp echoed around the room. Fifty gold per turnip meant over two thousand gold total—enough to transform him from a struggling farmer into a wealthy merchant.

"However," the Duke continued, "there are conditions. First, Miss Lin, you will remain here for one week to help establish the turnips in their new home and to teach my mages everything you know about this Witchcraft. Second, when you return to Eisenstadt, you will inform Professor Aldrich of what has happened here and request that he initiate formal research into your abilities. Third, you will accept my patronage for advanced magical study, with the understanding that any discoveries you make will be shared with my court."

The offer was generous but binding. Lin would become, in effect, the Duke's personal magical researcher, her innovations belonging as much to him as to her. It was the price of protection, of legitimacy, of turning her dangerous new magic into something the kingdom could accept.

"What about the Church?" Greta asked. "Lord Aldric seemed concerned about theological implications."

"Lord Aldric is concerned about many things," the Duke replied dryly. "But he answers to me, and I answer to the King. If His Majesty has no objections to conscious vegetables serving as agricultural advisors, then the Church will adapt its theology accordingly."

It was a masterful political solution, Lin realized. By reframing awakened creatures as servants rather than violations of natural order, the Duke removed the religious objections. By claiming them as his personal property, he controlled access to the technology. By binding Lin to his court, he ensured future innovations would serve his interests.

"Do you accept these terms, Miss Lin?"

Lin looked at her friends, seeing support and concern in equal measure. She thought about the turnips outside, who deserved safety and purpose. She considered Heinrich, whose livelihood hung in the balance. Most of all, she thought about the blackthorn's warnings about the dangers her power could unleash if misused.

"I accept, Your Grace."

The next several hours passed in a whirlwind of arrangements. The turnips were relocated to a specially prepared garden where they could live comfortably while serving as the Duke's agricultural consultants. Heinrich received his payment in a ceremony that attracted half the castle's population, cementing his transformation from farmer to celebrity. Lin began the difficult process of documenting her Witchcraft techniques for the Duke's scholars.

But the true work began that evening, when Duke Wilhelm summoned her to a private dinner to discuss the future.

"Tell me about this grandmother of yours," he said as they sat down to a meal of remarkable elegance. "Where did her stories come from?"

"The East, Your Grace. She never spoke much about her homeland, but her tales were full of spirits and magic that worked through partnership rather than domination."

"And you've never tried to find others who might practice similar techniques?"

"I wouldn't know where to look. My grandmother said she was the last of her people to come west."

The Duke nodded thoughtfully. "That may change. Word of your abilities will spread despite our precautions, and if there are others practicing similar magic, they may seek you out. Some will want to learn from you. Others may see you as a threat to their own power."

Lin felt a chill that had nothing to do with the evening air. "You think there will be opposition?"

"I think you've created something that challenges the established order, Miss Lin. The Academy teaches that magic comes from study and proper technique. The Church preaches that consciousness is a divine gift not to be granted lightly. You've proven both institutions partially wrong, and institutions don't like being proven wrong."

They ate in contemplative silence for several minutes before the Duke spoke again. "That's why you need protection, guidance, and very careful management of how your discoveries are revealed. This week will be crucial—we need to establish protocols, document procedures, and prepare responses to the questions that will inevitably come."

Over the following days, Lin threw herself into the work with desperate intensity. She taught the Duke's court mages everything she knew about Witchcraft theory, though none of them showed any aptitude for the techniques themselves. She worked with the castle's botanist to establish care protocols for conscious plants. Most importantly, she spent hours with the turnips, learning more about their thoughts and needs.

What she discovered both fascinated and troubled her. The turnips retained memories of their time as simple vegetables, but experienced their awakening as a kind of birth. They were grateful for consciousness but also occasionally overwhelmed by the complexity of thought and emotion. Big Bertha, as the largest and most developed, had essentially become their leader and spokesman, a responsibility she took very seriously.

"They're not just conscious," Lin explained to the Duke on her fourth day at the castle. "They're developing their own culture, their own social structures. Big Bertha is teaching the smaller turnips about music and cooperation. They've created games, established territories within the garden, even begun what appears to be agricultural experimentation."

"They're innovating," the Duke said with obvious satisfaction. "Excellent. That makes them valuable beyond their novelty. A community of conscious plants that can develop new farming techniques could revolutionize agriculture."

But Lin sensed something else in the turnips' behavior, something that worried her. They were happy in their new home, but they were also restless. They asked questions about the world beyond the castle, wondered about other vegetables they might help, dreamed of spreading their knowledge to gardens across the kingdom.

"They want to teach others," she told Willi on their last evening at the castle. "Not just vegetables, but humans too. They think farming should be a partnership between people and plants."

"That's beautiful," Willi said, but her expression was troubled. "Also potentially disruptive. Imagine if every farmer in the kingdom started treating their crops as partners instead of property."

"It could change everything."

"Yes, it could. The question is whether the kingdom is ready for that kind of change."

On the morning of their departure, Lin stood in the castle garden for one final conversation with the turnips. They had arranged themselves in a circle around her, their voices harmonizing in a song that somehow conveyed both farewell and promise.

"I have to go," she told them, kneeling in the rich soil. "But I'll be back. And I'll keep learning, keep growing, keep trying to understand what we've started together."

Big Bertha's response carried warmth, determination, and what sounded very much like a blessing. The other turnips added their voices, creating a chorus that spoke of hope and community and the endless possibilities that came with consciousness.

Heinrich joined them for the final goodbyes, his face showing the complex emotions of a parent sending children into the world. "Take care of yourselves," he whispered. "And take care of each other."

The turnips' promise was as clear as spoken words.

As the Luminous Dawn Seekers prepared to leave Königshafen, Lin felt the weight of what they'd accomplished and what lay ahead. Heinrich would return to his farm with enough gold to buy ten farms and a reputation that would open doors throughout the kingdom. The turnips would live comfortably as the Duke's agricultural advisors, the first conscious vegetables in recorded history.

But Lin knew this was just the beginning. Word would spread, questions would be asked, and other mages would try to replicate her techniques. Some would succeed, some would fail catastrophically. The world was about to become a much more complicated place.

"Ready?" Greta asked, checking her horse's tack one final time.

"As ready as anyone can be for changing the world," Lin replied, settling her blackthorn staff across her knees.

The road to Eisenstadt stretched ahead of them, and with it the challenge of explaining everything to Professor Aldrich and the Guild authorities. But for the first time since awakening her first turnip, Lin felt ready for whatever came next.

She was Lin Xiu, the First Witch, and she was beginning to understand that being first meant bearing the responsibility for everyone who would follow.
