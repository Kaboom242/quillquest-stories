# Chapter Seven: The Price of Wonder

Duke Wilhelm von Königshafen's smile died as the last rolling turnip came to rest beside his boots. The courtyard fell silent except for the gentle humming of forty-three vegetables who had just demonstrated consciousness, intelligence, and rescue instincts. In thirty years of rule, the Duke had seen magical innovations, political upheavals, and three separate attempts at assassination. But he had never seen anything that could fundamentally reshape the social order of his kingdom quite like this.

"Clear the courtyard," he commanded, his voice carrying the iron authority that had kept his duchy stable through two wars and a plague. "Everyone except the turnip handlers and their escort. Now."

The dispersal wasn't immediate—merchants clutched their most valuable produce while staring at the still-humming turnips, servants whispered frantically among themselves, and several nobles lingered with the calculating expressions of people witnessing either a miracle or a catastrophe. But gradually the courtyard emptied, leaving only the Luminous Dawn Seekers, Heinrich, his impossible crop, and a handful of the Duke's most trusted guards.

Lin caught fragments of conversation as people reluctantly moved away: _forbidden magic_, _Church won't stand for it_, _someone should send word to the capital_. Each whisper felt like a weight settling on her shoulders, and she gripped her blackthorn staff until her knuckles went white.

"Your Grace," Heinrich began, his voice shaking so badly the words barely formed, "I can explain about the turnips—"

"I'm sure you can, Master Grauber." The Duke's tone remained carefully neutral as he studied Big Bertha, who had positioned herself protectively in front of the smaller turnips. "But first, I want to understand exactly what we're dealing with." His gray eyes found Lin. "Miss...?"

"Lin Xiu, Your Grace." She forced herself to meet his gaze despite every instinct screaming at her to run. "The responsibility for this is mine."

"Responsibility for what, precisely?"

The question hung between them like a blade. Lin could deflect, could claim the turnips had always been magical, could spin some tale about ancient enchantments or mysterious curses. But looking at Heinrich's terror-pale face, at her friends' tense postures, at the turnips who had trusted her completely with their newfound consciousness, she knew there was only one answer that wouldn't poison everything she'd tried to build.

"For awakening consciousness in living vegetables without understanding the consequences, Your Grace."

Behind the Duke, Lord Aldric drew a sharp breath that sounded like air being sucked through a crack in ice. "Your Grace, this is precisely what the Church has warned about. Unregulated magical experimentation that violates the natural order established by the Luminant's divine will—"

"Lord Aldric." The Duke's voice carried enough warning to stop a charging boar. "I'll hear the girl's full explanation before any judgments are made."

Lin felt Greta shift closer, her armored presence radiating protective determination, and drew strength from her friend's unwavering loyalty. "The turnips were lonely, Your Grace. During our journey, I could sense their isolation—trapped in their cargo wagon, cut off from soil and sunlight, reduced to mere objects awaiting consumption. My grandmother taught me that everything has a spirit, that magic works best through partnership rather than domination. I reached out to them with respect and friendship, never intending for consciousness to awaken, but I can't say I regret what happened now that I've seen who they truly are."

As if summoned by her words, Big Bertha rolled forward with the dignified bearing of an ambassador approaching a foreign court. What followed could only be called a formal address—her voice rising and falling with practiced eloquence, every tone conveying meaning that transcended language. She spoke of gratitude and determination, of community and purpose, of the joy that came with thought and choice and the ability to help others.

Duke Wilhelm listened to the entire performance with the focused attention of someone accustomed to weighing complex testimony. When Big Bertha finished with what sounded suspiciously like a curtsy, he remained silent for a long moment, his weathered face revealing nothing of his thoughts.

"Thirty years ago," he said finally, "I fought alongside a battle-mage named Cornelius who could animate stone gargoyles to defend our walls. The magic was clean, controlled, devastatingly effective—and the creatures it created were empty shells with no thoughts beyond their basic programming." He gestured toward the turnips, who had arranged themselves in a loose semicircle as if preparing for a chorus performance. "These vegetables have personalities. They make independent choices. They demonstrate genuine concern for others. That's not standard animation magic, is it?"

"No, Your Grace. It's something entirely new."

"And entirely unauthorized," Lord Aldric interjected, his thin face flushed with the righteous indignation of someone whose worldview was being challenged. "Your Grace, the Church's position on consciousness manipulation is unambiguous. Such practices border on necromancy, violate the sacred boundary between soul and flesh, and represent a fundamental disrespect for the Luminant's divine order—"

"These turnips are not undead, Aldric," the Duke interrupted with ice in his voice. "They're more alive than they were before, not less. The theological implications are hardly as straightforward as you suggest."

Lin caught a flicker of hope at the Duke's words, but it guttered when she saw the calculating expression that crossed his features. She'd seen that look before—in the Academy's administrative offices when officials discussed her grandmother's "unorthodox" teachings, in merchants' eyes when they evaluated unfamiliar goods, in the faces of people trying to determine exactly how much trouble she might be worth.

"However," the Duke continued, his voice taking on the careful tone of a politician navigating dangerous waters, "the political implications are considerable. Word of this will spread—it may already be spreading—and there will be questions. From the Church hierarchy, from other nobles, from the King's court, possibly from the Emperor himself. I need to understand exactly what you've done and whether you can control it."

"I'm still learning to control it, Your Grace," Lin admitted, the honesty tasting bitter in her mouth. "But I could demonstrate—"

"Not here." The Duke cut her off with a sharp gesture. "Too many eyes, too many ears, too many people already looking for reasons to cause trouble. We'll continue this discussion privately." He turned to Heinrich, whose face had gone the color of old parchment. "Master Grauber, your original purpose here was to sell these turnips at my harvest festival?"

"Yes, Your Grace." Heinrich's voice cracked like a boy's changing. "Königshafen Purple Hearts, the finest in the kingdom. Though I'm not certain anyone will believe they're still just vegetables after this afternoon's... demonstration."

"Quite the understatement." Duke Wilhelm studied the turnips, who had begun humming again—something that sounded like a lullaby crossed with a work song. "The question becomes whether anyone will be willing to purchase conscious beings as festival produce."

The words hit Lin like a physical blow. She'd been so focused on getting the turnips to safety that she hadn't considered the impossibility of their original plan. Who would buy thinking, feeling creatures to roast for dinner? And without that sale, Heinrich would lose everything—his investment, his livelihood, possibly his freedom if authorities decided to pursue charges of practicing forbidden magic.

"Your Grace," she said desperately, "the fault is entirely mine. Heinrich did nothing wrong. If there are legal consequences—"

"There are always consequences, Miss Lin." The Duke's voice was not unkind, but it carried the weight of someone who had spent decades managing the aftermath of other people's choices. "The question is how to manage them in a way that serves everyone's interests. Follow me."

They were escorted not to the castle's great hall with its tapestries and formal grandeur, but to a modest solar overlooking the private gardens. Here, surrounded by windows that offered views of autumn-touched trees and carefully tended flower beds, Duke Wilhelm revealed the careful politician who had survived three decades of court intrigue.

"Sit," he commanded, gesturing to chairs arranged around a polished oak table. "We have much to discuss and little time before rumors begin breeding like rabbits in spring."

Tobi moved to close the heavy door behind them, his usual irreverent grin replaced by the watchful tension of someone who had grown up on streets where the wrong conversation could mean a knife in the dark. Willi conjured a small flame to warm her hands—a nervous habit Lin had noticed during their travels, as if fire magic was her way of grounding herself when the world became too unpredictable. Greta remained standing near the window, her hand resting casually on her sword hilt, ready for whatever might come.

"First question," the Duke began, settling into his chair with the careful movements of a man whose joints had seen too many battles. "Miss Lin, how many people know about your specific abilities?"

"Just our party, Your Grace. And Professor Aldrich at the Royal Academy, though he doesn't know about the awakening techniques specifically. He's aware that my magic is... unconventional."

"Good. That limits the immediate spread of detailed information, though I suspect general rumors are already racing toward every tavern in the duchy." The Duke's fingers drummed against the table's surface. "Second question—can you reverse what you've done to the turnips?"

Lin's breath caught in her throat. The possibility hadn't occurred to her, and the thought made her stomach clench with something that might have been nausea. "I... I don't know. I've never tried. But Your Grace, they're not damaged or cursed. They're just more than they were before."

"More than they were," the Duke repeated slowly, as if tasting the words for hidden meanings. "And what happens when other mages attempt to replicate your work? When every farmer in the kingdom demands conscious crops that can advise on their own cultivation? When the Church declares awakened vegetables an abomination that threatens the divine order?"

Each question hit like a hammer blow. Lin had been so focused on immediate problems—helping Heinrich, protecting the turnips, surviving the next crisis—that she hadn't considered the broader implications stretching out like ripples from a stone dropped in still water. Her magic could revolutionize agriculture, transform the relationship between humans and the natural world, spark religious warfare, or create new forms of slavery depending on how it was understood and applied.

"I don't know," she whispered, the admission scraping her throat raw.

"Exactly." Duke Wilhelm leaned forward, his weathered hands clasped before him. "You've stumbled onto something that could change the fundamental structure of society, and you have no plan for managing that change. That makes you extraordinarily dangerous, Miss Lin. Not evil, not malicious, but dangerous in the way that uncontrolled fire is dangerous—capable of providing warmth and light, or of burning down everything we've built."

Heinrich found his voice, though it came out barely above a whisper. "What about my turnips, Your Grace? What happens to them now?"

"That depends on several factors, Master Grauber." The Duke's attention shifted to include the farmer, whose face showed the hollow-eyed desperation of a man watching his life crumble. "Miss Lin, I want you to demonstrate this Witchcraft of yours, but carefully. Something small, controlled, reversible if necessary."

Lin looked around the solar, her mind racing through possibilities. There was a small potted herb on the windowsill—rosemary, from the sharp, clean scent that filled the corner of the room. Something simple, safe, easily contained if things went wrong.

"The rosemary?" she asked, gesturing toward the pot.

The Duke nodded his permission.

Lin approached the plant with careful, deliberate steps, her blackthorn staff humming softly in her hands like a tuning fork struck against stone. She knelt beside the earthenware pot and pressed her palm to the rich, dark soil, feeling for the tiny spark of life within. The rosemary's consciousness was like a small star seen from a great distance—uncomplicated and content, existing in the simple pleasures of sunlight and water and the satisfaction of growing toward the light.

She reached out gently with her magic, offering partnership rather than demanding submission, asking permission rather than taking what she wanted. The response came like a whispered welcome, and Lin felt the moment when awareness bloomed within the herb like a flower opening to dawn.

The change was subtle but unmistakable. The rosemary's leaves shimmered briefly with an inner light, and suddenly the plant's presence felt stronger, more defined, like the difference between hearing an echo and hearing a voice. It rustled without any wind, and Lin could sense its curiosity about the strangers in the room, its pleasure at this new form of existence.

"Hello," she whispered, her voice soft as prayer.

The rosemary's response came not in words but in a cascade of sensations and simple thoughts—warmth from the windowsill sunlight, satisfaction from recent watering, curiosity about the tall beings who moved through its world, gratitude for this new ability to perceive and understand. Basic concepts from a basic mind, but undeniably real, undeniably individual.

Duke Wilhelm watched this exchange with the intensity of a scholar observing the birth of a new species. "Can it understand complex ideas?"

Lin posed the question internally, asking the rosemary about the room, the people, the situation they all found themselves in. The responses were elementary—warm, safe, interesting, worried-feeling-from-the-humans—but showed clear comprehension and the ability to sense emotional undercurrents.

"To some degree, Your Grace. It's not human intelligence, but it's genuine awareness with the capacity for growth and learning."

"And can you reverse the process?"

This was the question Lin had been dreading since he first asked it. She reached out to the rosemary again, this time asking gently if it wanted to return to its previous state of simple existence, to give up thought and choice in exchange for the uncomplicated peace it had known before.

The plant's response was immediate and emphatic—a recoil that felt like physical revulsion, followed by what could only be called pleading. It preferred consciousness, preferred the ability to think and choose and communicate, preferred awareness even with its complications and worries to the blank simplicity of unconscious existence.

"It doesn't want to go back, Your Grace," Lin said, her voice thick with emotions she couldn't quite name. "It finds consciousness preferable to unconsciousness, despite the added complexity."

"I see." The Duke was quiet for several minutes, his fingers steepled as he worked through implications that stretched far beyond one awakened herb. When he finally spoke, his voice carried the weight of a decision that would reshape multiple lives. "Here's what we're going to do. The turnips cannot be sold as produce—that much is unambiguously clear. But they can be sold as something else entirely."

Lin's heart leaped with sudden hope. "What do you mean, Your Grace?"

"Companions. Advisors. Agricultural consultants. The first conscious vegetables in recorded history, capable of providing insights into farming that no human expert could match." The Duke's eyes gleamed with the same calculating expression Lin had noticed earlier, but now she recognized it as opportunity rather than threat. "I'll purchase the entire crop for fifty gold per turnip, not as food but as permanent residents of my castle, employed in the advancement of agricultural knowledge."

Heinrich's gasp echoed around the room like a stone dropped into still water. Fifty gold per turnip meant over two thousand gold total—enough to transform him from a struggling farmer into one of the wealthiest merchants in the kingdom, enough to buy land and livestock and security for the rest of his life.

"However," the Duke continued, and Lin felt her momentary relief begin to curdle, "there are conditions. Significant ones." His gaze fixed on her with uncomfortable intensity. "First, Miss Lin, you will remain here for one week to help establish the turnips in their new role and to teach my court mages everything you know about this Witchcraft of yours. Second, when you return to Eisenstadt, you will inform Professor Aldrich of everything that has happened here and request that he initiate formal research into your abilities under Academy oversight. Third, you will accept my patronage for advanced magical study, with the understanding that any significant discoveries you make will be shared with my court before being released to the broader magical community."

The offer was generous but binding in ways that made Lin's throat tighten with something approaching panic. She would become, in effect, the Duke's personal magical researcher, her innovations belonging as much to him as to her. It was the price of protection, of legitimacy, of turning her dangerous new magic into something the kingdom's power structures could accept and control.

"What about the Church?" Greta asked, her voice carrying the careful neutrality of someone navigating between personal faith and practical concerns. "Lord Aldric seemed deeply concerned about theological implications."

"Lord Aldric is concerned about many things," the Duke replied with dry amusement. "But he answers to me, just as I answer to the King, just as the King answers to the Emperor. If His Imperial Majesty has no objections to conscious vegetables serving as agricultural advisors rather than roast dinner, then the Church will discover ways to adapt its theology accordingly. The Luminant's light, after all, shines through all acts of creation and compassion."

It was masterful political maneuvering, Lin realized with growing admiration and unease. By reframing awakened creatures as servants rather than violations of natural order, the Duke removed the primary religious objections. By claiming them as his personal property, he controlled access to the technology and its applications. By binding Lin to his court through patronage, he ensured that future innovations would serve his interests first.

"Do you accept these terms, Miss Lin?"

Lin looked at her friends, seeing support and concern warring in their expressions. Tobi's usual irreverence had been replaced by something approaching worry—he understood the streets and the danger of owing debts to powerful people. Willi's motherly concern was obvious in the way she leaned forward, ready to speak up if Lin seemed overwhelmed. Greta's hand had moved away from her sword to rest on the table, a gesture of openness that somehow conveyed both trust and readiness to fight if necessary.

She thought about the turnips waiting outside, who deserved safety and purpose and the chance to grow into whatever they might become. She considered Heinrich, whose livelihood and freedom hung in the balance of this moment. Most of all, she remembered the blackthorn's cryptic warnings about the dangers her power could unleash if misused or misunderstood.

"I accept, Your Grace."

The next several hours passed in a controlled whirlwind of arrangements that transformed chaos into careful order. The turnips were relocated to a specially prepared section of the castle's herb garden, where they could live comfortably while serving their new role as the Duke's agricultural consultants. Heinrich received his payment in a formal ceremony that attracted every noble and wealthy merchant within the castle walls, cementing his transformation from farmer to celebrity and ensuring that word of his success would spread throughout the kingdom. Lin began the complex process of documenting her Witchcraft techniques for the Duke's scholars, trying to capture in words the intuitive magic her grandmother had taught through stories and songs.

But the real work began that evening, when Duke Wilhelm summoned her to a private dinner in his personal chambers to discuss implications that stretched far beyond one duchy's borders.

"Tell me about this grandmother of yours," he said as servants laid out a meal of remarkable elegance—roasted fowl with herbs that might well have been the rosemary she'd awakened, fresh bread still warm from the ovens, wine that spoke of careful aging and perfect harvest timing. "Where exactly did her stories originate?"

"The East, Your Grace." Lin chose her words carefully, aware that every detail might become politically significant. "She never spoke extensively about her homeland, but her tales were filled with spirits and magic that worked through partnership rather than domination, through respect rather than command."

"And you've never attempted to locate others who might practice similar techniques?"

"I wouldn't know where to begin looking. My grandmother said she was the last of her people to come west, that the old ways were dying out even in her homeland."

The Duke nodded thoughtfully, cutting his meat with the precise movements of someone accustomed to making every gesture count. "That may change sooner than you expect. Word of your abilities will spread despite our precautions—news this significant has a way of growing wings. If there are others practicing similar magic, in the East or elsewhere, they may seek you out. Some will want to learn from you, to study your techniques and innovations. Others may see you as a threat to their own power, or as a heretic violating traditions they consider sacred."

Lin felt a chill that had nothing to do with the evening air seeping through the chamber's windows. "You think there will be active opposition?"

"I think you've created something that challenges several established orders simultaneously, Miss Lin. The Academy teaches that magic comes from rigorous study and proper application of formulaic techniques. The Church preaches that consciousness is a divine gift not to be granted casually by mortal hands. The nobility assumes that magical innovations will be controlled and distributed through existing power structures." He paused to take a measured sip of wine. "You've proven all three institutions at least partially incorrect, and institutions have a remarkable talent for defending themselves against inconvenient truths."

They ate in contemplative silence for several minutes, the weight of unspoken implications settling over the meal like evening fog. Finally, the Duke spoke again.

"That's precisely why you need protection, guidance, and extremely careful management of how your discoveries are revealed to the world. This coming week will be crucial—we need to establish protocols, document procedures, and prepare responses to the questions that will inevitably arrive with the first curious visitors."

Over the following days, Lin threw herself into the work with an intensity born of equal parts enthusiasm and desperation. She spent hours with the Duke's court mages, attempting to teach them the theoretical foundations of Witchcraft, though none showed any aptitude for the techniques themselves. Their magic was too rooted in formulaic approaches, too dependent on commanding rather than partnering, too structured to accommodate the intuitive flexibility that Witchcraft required.

"It's like trying to teach sculpture to someone who's only ever worked with perfectly measured blocks," she complained to Willi on the third evening. "They keep asking for exact formulas and precise measurements, but Witchcraft doesn't work that way. Every plant, every spirit, every situation is different."

"Maybe that's the point," Willi suggested, stirring a pot of soup that filled their guest quarters with the scent of herbs and comfort. "Maybe they're not supposed to learn it easily. Maybe being the First Witch means you're the one who has to figure out how to teach something that can't be taught in traditional ways."

Lin worked extensively with Master Aldwin, the castle's chief botanist, to establish care protocols for conscious plants. Together they discovered that awakened vegetables had needs beyond simple soil and sunlight—they craved intellectual stimulation, social interaction, and meaningful work that made use of their new capabilities.

"Fascinating," Master Aldwin murmured as they watched Big Bertha directing a group of smaller turnips in what appeared to be an investigation of soil composition. "They're not just conscious—they're naturally collaborative, instinctively educational. Look how she's teaching the others to test different soil conditions."

Most importantly, Lin spent long hours with the turnips themselves, learning about their thoughts, needs, and the surprising complexity of their emerging society. What she discovered both fascinated and troubled her in ways she struggled to articulate.

The turnips retained clear memories of their time as simple vegetables, but experienced their awakening as a form of birth—simultaneously wonderful and overwhelming. They were grateful for consciousness but occasionally felt crushed by the weight of thought and emotion, the endless complexity of a world that had suddenly become vast beyond their previous comprehension.

Big Bertha, as the largest and most developed, had naturally assumed leadership responsibilities she took with touching seriousness. She was teaching the smaller turnips about music, cooperation, and the art of growing in harmony with their environment. They had created simple games, established personal territories within their garden space, and begun what could only be called agricultural experiments—testing different soil compositions, water schedules, and companion plantings with the methodical curiosity of natural scientists.

"They're not just conscious," Lin explained to the Duke on her fourth day at the castle, as they stood watching the turnips conduct what appeared to be a formal debate about fertilizer applications. "They're developing their own culture, their own social structures, their own approaches to understanding the world. Big Bertha is functioning as both teacher and leader, but the others are developing individual specialties—one focuses on soil chemistry, another on weather patterns, a third on the emotional states of nearby plants."

"They're innovating," the Duke observed with obvious satisfaction. "Excellent. That makes them valuable beyond their novelty status. A community of conscious plants that can develop new farming techniques through direct experimentation could revolutionize agriculture throughout the kingdom."

But Lin sensed something else in the turnips' behavior, something that filled her with a mixture of pride and worry she couldn't quite shake. They were happy in their new home, clearly grateful for the safety and purpose the Duke provided, but they were also restless in ways that spoke to larger ambitions.

They asked constant questions about the world beyond the castle walls, wondered aloud about other vegetables they might be able to help, dreamed of sharing their knowledge with gardens and farms across the kingdom. They had developed what could only be called a mission—to spread consciousness and partnership between plants and humans wherever such cooperation might flourish.

"They want to teach others," she confided to Willi on their final evening at the castle. "Not just vegetables, but humans as well. They believe farming should be a genuine partnership between people and plants, with both sides contributing knowledge and effort toward mutual benefit."

"That's beautiful," Willi said, but her expression carried the shadow of deeper concerns. "Also potentially revolutionary in ways that make my head spin. Imagine if every farmer in the kingdom started treating their crops as partners instead of property, if vegetables could advise on their own cultivation and harvest timing."

"It could change everything about how we produce food, how we relate to the natural world, how we understand consciousness itself."

"Yes, it could. The question that keeps me awake at night is whether the kingdom—whether the world—is ready for that magnitude of change."

On the morning of their departure, Lin stood in the castle garden for one final conversation with the turnips. They had arranged themselves in their now-familiar circle, their voices harmonizing in a song that somehow conveyed both farewell and promise, gratitude and determination.

"I have to leave now," she told them, kneeling in the rich soil that had become their new home. "But I'll return when I can. And I'll keep learning, keep growing, keep trying to understand what we've started together and where it might lead."

Big Bertha's response carried the warmth of deep affection, the strength of unshakeable determination, and what sounded very much like a formal blessing offered from one pioneer to another. The other turnips added their voices, creating a chorus that spoke of hope and community and the endless possibilities that consciousness could create when guided by wisdom and compassion.

Heinrich joined them for the final goodbyes, his face showing the complex emotions of a parent sending children into the world—pride and worry and love all tangled together in expressions that shifted moment by moment.

"Take care of yourselves," he whispered to the turnips, his voice thick with feelings he couldn't quite name. "Take care of each other. Remember that someone believed in you before you even knew you could think."

The turnips' collective promise resonated with the solemnity of a sacred vow.

As the Luminous Dawn Seekers prepared to depart Königshafen, Lin felt the full weight of what they'd accomplished and what lay ahead pressing down on her shoulders like a physical burden. Heinrich would return to his farm carrying enough gold to buy ten such farms and a reputation that would open doors throughout the kingdom. The turnips would live safely as the Duke's agricultural advisors, the first conscious vegetables in recorded history, pioneering a new form of existence that might reshape the world.

But Lin knew with crystalline certainty that this was merely the beginning of something much larger and more complex than any of them fully understood. Word would spread like wildfire through the kingdom's networks of merchants and nobles and scholars. Questions would be asked, demonstrations demanded, replications attempted. Some would succeed, some would fail catastrophically, and the world was about to become a much more complicated place for everyone who lived in it.

"Ready?" Greta asked, checking her horse's tack one final time, her armor gleaming in the morning light.

"As ready as anyone can be for changing the world," Lin replied, settling her blackthorn staff across her knees as their wagon began to roll toward Königshafen's gates.

The road to Eisenstadt stretched ahead of them like a ribbon of possibility and peril, and with it the daunting challenge of explaining everything to Professor Aldrich and the Guild authorities. But for the first time since accidentally awakening her first turnip, Lin felt genuinely prepared for whatever consequences might follow.

She was Lin Xiu, the First Witch, and she was beginning to understand that being first meant accepting responsibility not just for her own discoveries, but for everyone who would follow in her footsteps down this strange new path she'd opened between the human world and the green realm of growing things.
