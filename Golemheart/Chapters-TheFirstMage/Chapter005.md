# Chapter Five: The Garden's Secret

Lin Xiu woke before dawn, her breath misting in the cold air. Something had changed in the night. Heinrich's turnips had abandoned their wagons again, but this time they'd formed an intricate mandala in the dirt—each bulb positioned with mathematical precision, their pale skins glowing faintly in the pre-dawn gloom. The sight made her stomach clench with unease.

She knelt among them, pressing her palm to the earth. The turnips' thoughts hit her like a tide: longing, purpose, an ache to be more than cargo. But underneath their simple desires, she felt something else—a presence vast and patient, watching from the grove's shadowed depths. The laylines beneath her fingers thrummed with warning.

"Lin?" Greta's voice was soft but alert. The knight sat up in her bedroll, hand instinctively reaching for her sword. "What's wrong?"

"The turnips," Lin whispered, not daring to move. "They're... different."

Tobi rolled over, hair sticking up at wild angles. His usual smirk faltered when he saw the vegetable formation. "Okay, that's definitely not normal. Even for Heinrich's magical produce." His voice carried a tremor he tried to hide behind humor.

Willi emerged from her tent, already dressed and tying her hair back. She took one look at the mandala and swore softly. "Lin, step away from them. Slowly."

"I don't think they want to hurt us," Lin said, but her voice shook. The turnips pulsed gently beneath her touch, sharing images of soil and sunshine, of roots spreading deep and wide. "They want to teach me something."

Heinrich appeared at the edge of camp, his face pale in the growing light. "Sweet mother of—what have they done now?" He approached the formation cautiously, wringing his hands. "This is my livelihood, you understand? If the Duke thinks I'm practicing forbidden magic—"

"You're not," Lin said firmly, though she wasn't entirely sure. "This is something else. Something new."

Greta stood, armor clanking softly. "Lin, your grandmother's stories—did any of them mention vegetables arranging themselves?"

Lin almost laughed despite her fear. "No, but she always said magic finds its own way." She closed her eyes, reaching out with the careful touch her grandmother had taught her. "What do you want?" she whispered to the turnips.

The answer came not in words but in a cascade of images: a garden where plants and people learned together, where consciousness flowed between roots and minds, where the old barriers between magic and mundane dissolved. The vision was beautiful and terrifying.

"They want to help create something," Lin said, her voice barely audible. "A place where plants can think and choose and grow beyond what they were meant to be."

Tobi's laugh was brittle, masking deeper unease. "A school for scholarly squash? A university for..." He paused, seeing Lin's expression grow serious. "You're not joking about this, are you?"

"The images were so clear," Lin whispered, her voice barely audible above the wind. "Plants with thoughts, with choices. Gardens where consciousness flows like water." She looked up at her friends, fear and wonder warring in her eyes. "What if I'm not ready for this? What if I awaken something that shouldn't be awake?"

"Dead serious about the risks," Willi said, her usual cheerfulness tempered by caution. She moved closer with a pouch of seeds, her fingers careful as she pressed them into Lin's palm. "But Lin, if you're going to try awakening consciousness in plants, start with something smaller. Something that won't bring half the guild down on us if it goes wrong." The seeds were warm from her touch, selected with a cook's practiced eye. "Basil, thyme, mint. Kitchen herbs that know humans, that want to help. Safe herbs."

Heinrich's face had gone ashen, his hands wringing together as he watched his livelihood transform before his eyes. "Sweet mother of mercy, if the Duke thinks I'm practicing forbidden magic—if the guild decides my turnips are evidence of necromancy or worse—" His voice cracked with genuine terror. "This isn't just about explaining vegetables anymore. This is about whether I'll be branded a dark mage and burned at the stake."

The weight of Heinrich's very real fear sobered them all. Lin looked at the turnip formation, understanding for the first time the true stakes of what she was attempting.

Lin's hands trembled as she accepted the pouch. "What if I hurt them? What if I change them into something they don't want to be?"

Greta knelt beside her, placing a steady hand on her shoulder. "Then you listen first. That's what courage means—not the absence of fear, but the willingness to hear what others need, even when you're terrified of the answer."

Heinrich cleared his throat nervously. "Not to interrupt this philosophical moment, but could we perhaps do this somewhere other than a public road? If a patrol comes by and sees my turnips performing geometric patterns—"

"The grove," Lin said suddenly, pointing toward the cluster of trees near the stream. "There. Away from the road, near running water. Grandmother always said water carries wisdom."

They moved carefully, Heinrich coaxing his turnips back to their wagon with promises of proper soil soon. The grove felt different as they approached—older, more aware. Ancient oaks and birches created a natural amphitheater, their branches forming a cathedral of green shadows. At the center stood a massive blackthorn tree, its bark twisted with age, its branches heavy with thorns and memory.

Lin found a patch of rich soil near the stream and knelt, cradling a basil seed. The others formed a loose circle around her, watching with mixture of anticipation and dread. She could feel their faith in her, and it was almost more frightening than the magic itself.

"I don't know what I'm doing," she admitted.

"None of us do," Willi said gently. "That's what makes it an adventure."

Lin pressed the seed into the earth, her grandmother's voice echoing in memory: "Listen first, command never. The soil knows old secrets." She reached out tentatively, offering partnership instead of power. The seed's response hit her like a whisper-shout—desperate longing mixed with ancient caution. 

As consciousness bloomed within the tiny shell, Lin felt the laylines shiver beneath her fingertips. Something vast stirred in the grove's depths, awakened by her amateur touch. Magic coursed through her like liquid starlight, connecting her to currents of power she'd never imagined. She asked the trees for wisdom, the stream for nourishment, the spirits of the grove for their blessing—and felt them all respond with eager, overwhelming generosity.

The basil's consciousness burst into being like a tiny green star, and Lin opened her eyes to see a perfect shoot glowing in the morning light, its leaves trembling with newfound awareness. But something else stirred too—something far older and stranger than a simple herb.

"It worked," she breathed, staring at the glowing shoot.

The party's reaction was immediate and varied. Tobi let out a whoop and spun in a circle, his usual bravado masking what she suspected was genuine terror. Willi dropped her ladle with a clatter, her face cycling between wonder and worry. Greta fell to her knees, armored hands pressed together in what looked suspiciously like prayer—or perhaps an attempt to ward off heresy. Even Heinrich managed a shaky smile, though his eyes never left his transformed turnips.

"By the Luminant's grace," Greta whispered, "what have you done?"

"I don't know," Lin admitted, panic rising in her chest. "I don't know."

But their celebration was cut short by a sound like breaking bones. The ancient blackthorn shuddered, its bark splitting with sharp cracks. Lin's blood ran cold as she realized what she'd done—her magic had awakened far more than a simple herb.

A face emerged from the twisted bark, ancient and otherworldly. Eyes of amber resin fixed on Lin with an intelligence older than kingdoms. When the tree spoke, its voice was the whisper of wind through autumn leaves mixed with something altogether stranger.

"Brillig burns the witchling-wake," it murmured, words tumbling like autumn leaves. "First of the rootless-rooted, seedling of the grandmere's whisper-tales."

The silence that followed was deafening. Lin felt her friends' shock ripple outward like stones dropped in still water. She'd never told them about her grandmother's stories, about the title that felt too large and dangerous to claim.

"I don't understand—" Lin began.

"Mimsy understanding borogroves not," the blackthorn continued, its speech a puzzle wrapped in riddles. "Grandmere-wise knew the snicker-snack of time's own blade. Prepared thee as moonbeams prepare the night, but some paths must be walked with tulgey-step alone." The tree's gaze swept over the party, ancient eyes cataloguing each face. "Well-chosen thy band of blade-bright and fire-friend, of laugh-song and turnip-tender. They shall anchor when the vorpal winds seek to carry thee to regions unexplored."

Greta found her voice first, though it cracked slightly. "You're... ancient. How long have you watched this grove?"

"Since the mimsy kingdoms were but borogove-dreams," the blackthorn replied, its words weaving patterns in the air. "Since humans first scribbled their memory-marks upon beast-skin and bark. Long have I kept vigil, knowing the old magics would one day wake from their galumphing slumber." Its attention returned to Lin, and she felt the weight of eons in that gaze. "But frabjous surprise—it comes in such a small and wonder-bright package."

Lin felt tears prick her eyes, her grandmother's voice echoing in memory with fragments of half-remembered nonsense rhymes. "I don't know what I'm doing. I'm afraid I'll hurt someone, or break something that can't be mended."

The tree's laughter was like wind through dry leaves, touched with ancient merriment. "Fear is wisdom's first brillig gift, little witch-ling. Right to be afraid, oh yes. Magic is no beamish toy, and consciousness no mere game of cards and queens. Every wake-making carries its whiffling price." Its expression grew grave, bark deepening with shadow. "Some spirits will welcome thy gentle touch with slithy grace. Others will turn toves-nasty, resist with claws and teeth. A few will speak the jabberwock-lies, hunger for thy gifts with vorpal appetite, seek to twist thy wonder-work to their own dark purposes. Listen thou must—not just to the words that tumble bright, but to the shadows where the boojum-truths hide."

"How can I tell the difference?" Lin whispered, her hands shaking.

"By paying the galumphing price of learning-pain," the blackthorn said, its voice now gentle as summer rain. "By failing with brillig grace, and growing stronger with each tulgey step." The tree's branches rustled, and one gnarled limb broke away with a sound like sighing, reshaping itself into a walking staff etched with living runes that seemed to shift and dance. "Take this frumious gift. Let it remind thee that growth is slow as winter mornings, wisdom earned drop by precious drop, and every blessing carries its own borogove-shadow."

Lin accepted the staff with trembling hands. The wood pulsed with warmth and life, thrumming with magic older than memory. "Thank you."

"Thank me not yet, snicker-snack child," the tree warned, its voice fading like mist at dawn. "The path thou walks will change thee, and through thee, the whole bright world will shift and galumph in new directions. Some will call thee savior-bright. Others will name thee destroyer-dark. The truth, as always, dances between the brillig and the slithy, somewhere in the tulgey wood of maybe." The face melted back into bark, but the presence remained—watchful, patient, protective as an ancient riddle guarding its own answer.

Lin stood slowly, staff in hand, and turned to face her friends. They stared at her with expressions ranging from awe to concern to something that might have been fear. The strange words of the blackthorn still echoed in her mind, half-familiar from her grandmother's nonsense songs.

Tobi was the first to break the silence, though his usual confidence seemed shaken. "So... that tree just spoke in riddles that somehow made perfect sense while making no sense at all. And you're apparently the First Witch?" He ran a hand through his hair. "I feel like I should be more surprised, but honestly, after traveling with you, Lin, this feels oddly inevitable."

"Brillig," Lin said quietly, the word tasting strange on her tongue. "Grandmother used to say that word when she told her stories. I never knew what it meant."

Willi stepped forward, her practical nature reasserting itself despite the morning's strangeness. "I don't care if ancient trees speak in poetry or prophecy. You're still our Lin." She paused, studying the staff in Lin's hands. "Though I have to ask—do you understand what that thing was saying?"

Lin nodded slowly. "Most of it. It's like... like a language I knew once but forgot, except I never actually knew it." She looked down at the staff, feeling its warmth pulse against her palm. "My grandmother used to sing nonsense songs full of those words. I thought they were just made-up."

Greta stepped closer, her knightly bearing softened by genuine concern. "Lin, when it called you the First Witch... what does that mean for you? For us?"

"I don't know," Lin admitted, her voice small. "I never asked for any of this. I just wanted to help Heinrich's turnips feel less lonely."

Heinrich cleared his throat, looking pale but determined. "Well, legendary figure or not, those turnips still need to get to Königshafen. And now they're not just magical—they're blessed by whatever that ancient thing was." He gestured toward his wagon, where the turnips had arranged themselves into neat rows. "I'm not sure if that makes them worth a fortune or makes them completely unsellable."

The practicality of Heinrich's concern grounded them all. Despite the morning's revelations, they still had a journey to complete and lives to live.

"We figure it out as we go," Lin said, surprising herself with the steadiness in her voice. "The tree—whatever it was—it said my friends would anchor me. I think... I think that means I don't have to face this alone."

As they packed up camp, the basil plant glowed softly in its patch of soil, content and aware. The turnips had arranged themselves into a neat traveling formation, ready for the road. And Lin walked among them all, staff in hand, feeling the weight of her grandmother's legacy and the trust of her friends.

The journey to Königshafen was different now. Lin walked with new awareness of the magic flowing around them—the whispers of grass beside the road, the sleepy contentment of farmyard animals, the patient watchfulness of ancient trees. Her friends had questions, but they gave her space to process the morning's revelations.

At midday, they stopped by a roadside shrine dedicated to a local saint. Lin knelt and planted another seed—mint this time—offering the same partnership and respect. The awakening was gentler this time, more controlled, but she could feel curious eyes watching from hedgerows and meadows. Word was spreading through the plant kingdom that something new had entered the world.

"The stories will remember this day," Greta said softly as they resumed their journey.

"Good stories or cautionary tales?" Lin asked.

"That," Greta replied with a smile, "depends entirely on what we do next."

As evening approached and they made camp, Lin sat by the fire with her staff glowing softly in her lap. The turnips had formed another pattern—not a mandala this time, but something that looked almost like a map, with pathways and destinations marked in root vegetable arrangement.

"They're trying to tell us something," she murmured.

Willi looked up from her cooking. "What do you think it means?"

Lin studied the formation, feeling the weight of her new responsibilities. "I think they're showing us where we need to go. Places where other spirits are waiting to be awakened. Or maybe..." She paused, remembering the blackthorn's warnings. "Places where things are waiting that shouldn't be disturbed."

Tobi strummed his lute thoughtfully. "Well, whatever it is, it sounds like an adventure. And honestly, after today, I'm ready for whatever comes next."

"Are you?" Lin asked, looking around at her friends. "Really? Because I have a feeling this is just the beginning."

Greta's hand rested on her sword hilt, but her smile was warm. "Then we face it together. Whatever comes, we face it as one."

As night fell and the stars emerged, Lin closed her eyes and listened to the voices of the awakened plants around them—the content murmur of the basil, the excited chatter of the mint, the deeper whispers of the turnips as they shared their ancient secrets. She was the First Witch, carrying her grandmother's legacy into an uncertain future. But she was not alone.

The road ahead stretched into darkness, filled with possibilities both wonderful and terrible. And Lin Xiu, staff in hand and friends by her side, was ready to meet them all.
