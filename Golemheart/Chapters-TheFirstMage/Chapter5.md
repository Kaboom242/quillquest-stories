# Chapter Five: The Garden's Secret

Lin Xiu woke to the hush of dawn, dew cold on her skin, the campfire’s embers barely alive. Heinrich’s turnips had abandoned their wagons again, forming a spiral in the dirt—each bulb straining toward the earth as if desperate to root. Lin knelt, pressing her palm to the soil, feeling the pulse of longing beneath her fingertips. The laylines throbbed, not with power, but with warning.

Tobi, hair wild and eyes wary, squinted at the formation. “If they start chanting, I’m gone. I don’t trust vegetables with choreography.” His joke was brittle, masking unease.

Willi, stirring a pot, snorted. “If they start reciting recipes, I’ll ask for their secrets. But I’m not eating anything that talks back.” She eyed the spiral, uncertain.

Greta, armor dulled by travel, crouched beside Lin. “You have a gift. But gifts can be burdens. Don’t let fear blind you.” Her grip on Lin’s shoulder was firm, almost desperate.

Heinrich hovered, face pale. “If the Duke’s turnips start painting, I’ll be ruined. Or famous. Or both.”

Lin’s smile faltered. The turnips pulsed beneath her hand, a silent question. She hesitated, remembering stories of witches who bent nature and left fields barren. Instead of reaching out with power, she whispered, “What do you want?”

The answer came not in words, but in a shiver through the soil—a yearning to be more than cargo, to root themselves in purpose. Lin’s breath caught. For the first time, she felt the difference between commanding and listening.

“They want to help us create a garden,” she said, voice thin. “Not here, not now. Someday—a place where plants and people learn together.”

Tobi’s laugh was hollow. “A school for sentient spinach. I’ll bring the chalk.” But his gaze lingered on Lin, searching for certainty.

Willi pressed a pouch of seeds into Lin’s hands. “Start small. Basil, thyme, mint. If you’re going to wake something, make sure it’s gentle.”

Lin’s hands shook. “What if I do something wrong?”

Greta’s reply was quiet. “Courage is listening, even when you’re terrified.”

Lin found a patch of soil near the stream and knelt, cradling a basil seed. She reached out, offering partnership. The seed’s response was hesitant—a flicker of green hope. Lin promised it would remain a basil, but with the gift of self-awareness. The grove seemed to lean in, the stream whispering, the laylines pulsing with warning.

A spark of consciousness flickered, then grew. Lin planted the seed, asking the trees for wisdom, the stream for nourishment, the laylines for purpose. When she opened her eyes, a green shoot glowed in the morning light, trembling. The basil’s awareness was simple, but uneasy—a sense of purpose, but also confusion.

“It worked,” Lin whispered, awe and dread tangled in her chest. The party gathered, each member reacting in their own way. Tobi clapped her back, Willi offered tea, Greta bowed her head. Heinrich watched, eyes wide, mouth tight.

But as Lin reached for another seed, the basil’s leaves curled inward, shivering. A shadow flickered across the soil—brief, but unmistakable. The turnips, emboldened, twisted into a mandala, their skins pulsing. Lin’s panic rose—what if she’d unleashed something she couldn’t control? The air thickened, the laylines throbbed. Greta stepped back, eyes narrowed. “Lin, stop. Something’s wrong.”

Lin’s hands froze. The basil’s roots writhed, tangling with the turnips. Willi dropped her ladle, voice sharp. “Lin, you’re scaring them. And us.”

Heinrich’s voice cracked. “Are they supposed to do that?”

Lin retreated to the edge of the grove, seeking the oldest blackthorn tree. Its bark was split, branches heavy with rot. Lin pressed her palm to the trunk, voice shaking: “I don’t know if I’m ready. I don’t want to hurt anyone.”

The air grew dense, heavy with the scent of sap and decay. The bark split, and a face emerged—eyes glimmering with resin and shadow, mouth twisted. The tree’s voice was the groan of wood, the hush of roots in deep earth. “You come with questions, little witch. Not to command, but to listen. That is rare. But beware: the world is not gentle with those who wake what should sleep. Roots run deep, and some secrets are best left tangled.”

Lin flinched. “I’m afraid. Afraid I’ll fail, or make things worse.”

The blackthorn’s laughter was a dry rasp. “Failure is a seed, not a stone. You will fail, and you will grow. But know this: not every spirit wishes to be known. Some will lie. Some will hunger. Some will twist your gifts into thorns. Magic is a risk, not a gift. You must ask, and listen. Let each spirit choose its own path, and do not trust every answer.”

Lin knelt, tears stinging. “How do I know I’m not forcing them?”

The tree’s eyes narrowed, sap dripping. “You cannot force what does not wish to wake. But you can be deceived. You can be used. You can be changed. Offer, and wait. That is the way of the world. But remember: even the gentlest gardener must prune.”

The blackthorn’s branches shivered, dropping a single blossom into Lin’s palm—a flower with petals like shards of bone. “Take this. Let it remind you that growth is slow, and wisdom comes from listening. But beware—every gift has its price, and every root its shadow.”

Lin accepted the blossom, feeling the thrum of old magic. The tree’s face faded, but its presence lingered—a watchful, patient awareness. She felt marked, not chosen.

She returned to camp, blossom in hand, her friends waiting. Tobi’s voice was low. “So… did the tree actually talk to you, or did you just have a really intense nightmare?”

Lin managed a laugh. “It talked. It warned me.”

Greta knelt, solemn. “You have done something dangerous, Lin Xiu. To awaken a spirit so ancient and earn its trust is no small feat.”

Willi eyed the blossom. “Does it do anything? Or is it just a warning?”

Lin shrugged. “It’s a promise. I have to keep listening—to the plants, to the spirits, to the world. I can’t just use magic. I have to earn it.”

Heinrich, herding his turnips, cleared his throat. “If you’re done talking to trees, could someone help me explain to the Duke why his vegetables are now aspiring sculptors?”

Tobi snorted. “Tell him it’s the latest trend in magical produce. Next season, all the nobles will want turnips with artistic sensibilities.”

Greta’s smile was thin. “Let’s get to Königshafen before the turnips stage a full exhibition.”

Lin looked at her friends, at the conscious turnips, at the blossom in her hands. Gratitude and dread warred inside her. “Thank you,” she said, voice raw. “For letting me try, even when I don’t know what I’m doing.”

Willi slung an arm around her shoulders. “That’s what parties are for, Lin. We make mistakes together, and we learn together. If you ever awaken a carnivorous cabbage, I’ll be ready with a fireball.”

Tobi winked. “And I’ll write a song about it. ‘The Ballad of the Bewildered Brassica.’”

Greta stood, weary. “Let’s go forward, then, as partners—not just with each other, but with the world itself. Today, we’ve planted something new. Let’s hope it grows true.”

As the party packed up camp, Lin lingered, her gaze drifting over the grove. The blackthorn’s face was gone, but its presence remained—a watchful, patient awareness. She pressed her palm to the blossom, feeling the magic thrumming beneath the petals. She was not alone. She was part of something larger—a web of consciousness stretching from the smallest seed to the oldest tree. As she stepped onto the road, surrounded by friends and sentient vegetables, she knew she was ready to listen, to learn, and to risk everything.

The journey to Königshafen was slow, the road winding through fields and forests alive with possibility and threat. Lin walked at the front, the blossom tucked behind her ear, the turnips rolling in formation behind the wagon. The party’s conversation was lighter, but tinged with unease. Tobi tried to teach a turnip to juggle, Willi debated the merits of magical fertilizer, Greta recited poetry to the trees, and Heinrich fretted about the Duke’s reaction to his increasingly artistic produce.

At midday, they stopped by a stream, the water cold and fast. Lin knelt, planting another seed, her magic careful, uncertain. The trees leaned in, the laylines pulsed, and another shoot glowed with new awareness—this time, its leaves curled, wary. Willi watched, silent. “You’re changing the world, Lin. One plant at a time. Just… be careful.”

Greta nodded. “You are a pioneer, a gardener of consciousness. The stories will remember you. But so will the shadows.”

Tobi grinned, but his eyes darted to the turnips. “Just make sure the stories are funny. I want at least one chapter about the turnip uprising.”

Lin laughed, but her fear lingered. She felt the web of consciousness growing, each new plant a thread in the tapestry of magic—and risk. The road ahead was uncertain, and she was no longer sure she wanted to walk it alone.

That night, as the party camped beneath the stars, Lin sat by the fire, the blossom glowing faintly. The turnips arranged themselves into a new pattern, a spiral that pulsed with life and something darker. Lin closed her eyes, listening to the voices of the grove, the stream, the laylines. She felt her grandmother’s presence, not as a memory, but as a warning.

She was ready to learn, to grow, to listen. But as she drifted to sleep, the blackthorn’s warning echoed—a reminder that every root has its shadow, and every gift its price.
