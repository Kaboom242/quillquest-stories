# Chapter 15: The Haunted Bridge - Draft 1

The morning after leaving Rowan Hollow felt like stepping out of a fever dream into crisp, clean reality. Lin breathed deeply of air that tasted properly of summer grass and distant rain clouds, savoring the absence of that metallic corruption that had clung to her throat for days. Her horse's hooves found steady rhythm on the stone road that led northwest toward the Silberbach river, where Guild reports spoke of travelers trapped by supernatural phenomena at the old stone bridge.

Willi unfolded the contract parchment against her saddle horn, scanning the details again with the methodical attention she brought to all their jobs. "Bridge has been impassable for five days now. Merchants report seeing figures on the span that vanish when approached, and water that speaks in voices of the drowned." She looked up with a frown that suggested she found the latter claim particularly suspect. "Local garrison tried to clear it twice, but their horses refuse to set hoof on the stones."

"Horses have more sense than most soldiers," Tobi observed, strumming a cheerful melody that bounced off the surrounding hills. "They can smell death magic from a mile away. Unlike humans, who require actual corpses before we start asking uncomfortable questions."

Greta's armor clinked as she shifted to study the horizon ahead, where the Silberbach's valley cut a green wound through the rolling farmland. "The Light has shown me visions of restless spirits in my prayers," she said solemnly. "Souls trapped between this world and the next, unable to find peace due to unfinished business or violent death." Her voice carried the weight of someone who'd dealt with such hauntings before. "They often manifest near water, which holds memories of those who died within it."

Lin nodded, though part of her attention was already reaching ahead with her magical senses, feeling for the disruption they'd been sent to investigate. The laylines here flowed smoothly beneath the summer earth, carrying the healthy pulse of growing things and seasonal change. But as they crested the final hill and the river valley spread below them, she felt something like a knot in the magical current—not the screaming agony of the corrupted Rowan tree, but a tangle of confusion and old grief that made her chest tighten with sympathetic pain.

The bridge stretched across the Silberbach like a backbone of gray stone, its five arches perfectly proportioned to span the water that ran dark and swift with recent mountain rain. But even from a distance, Lin could see that something was fundamentally wrong with the structure. Frost glittered along the stone railings despite the summer heat, and mist rose from the water in patterns that had nothing to do with temperature differences.

More disturbing were the figures that moved along the span—pale shapes that seemed solid until you looked directly at them, then became translucent as morning fog. Lin counted seven distinct forms pacing back and forth across the bridge, their movements suggesting both urgency and terrible repetition.

"Well," Tobi said with forced cheer, "at least they're staying on the bridge instead of wandering the countryside frightening livestock. That shows admirable self-restraint for vengeful spirits."

They approached the bridge from the south bank, where a small crowd of frustrated travelers had established an impromptu camp. Merchants with wagons full of goods bound for northern markets sat around cook fires, shooting dark looks at the haunted span. A young couple with a baby tried to comfort the infant, whose wails suggested he could sense the supernatural disturbance even if he couldn't understand it.

Lin dismounted near an elderly merchant whose weathered face spoke of decades spent navigating difficult trade routes. "How long have they been walking back and forth like that?" she asked, gesturing toward the ghostly figures.

"Five days now," the man replied, his voice carrying the exhaustion of someone who'd watched the same impossible sight for too long. "Started right after the big storm passed through. Water rose faster than anyone's ever seen, then when it went down again, they were there." He pointed at the spirits with a hand that trembled slightly. "Can't get close enough to see their faces proper, but they keep reaching for something in the water. Something they can't quite touch."

Willi was already unpacking her notebook, methodically interviewing each stranded traveler about what they'd witnessed. Lin caught fragments of their accounts as she studied the bridge itself—stories of voices calling from beneath the water, of the stone span growing so cold that ice formed on the railings in broad daylight, of horses and oxen refusing to approach no matter how harshly they were driven.

Greta knelt by the water's edge downstream from the bridge, her gauntleted hands cupped as if in prayer. When she looked up, her expression was troubled. "I can feel their anguish from here," she said quietly. "These are not malevolent spirits seeking to harm the living. They're lost souls, trapped by some trauma they cannot resolve."

Lin approached the bridge's southern approach, feeling the temperature drop noticeably as she drew near the first stone arch. The Silberbach flowed dark and swift beneath the span, its surface broken by eddies that suggested deep currents and hidden obstacles. When she extended her magical senses toward the structure, the confusion she'd felt from a distance became sharper, more focused.

The laylines beneath the bridge were tangled but not corrupted—twisted into knots that spoke of sudden violence and unfinished business, but not the deliberate torture she'd found at Rowan Hollow. This felt more like a wound that had healed badly, leaving scar tissue that pulled and ached whenever the magical currents tried to flow naturally.

"There was a tragedy here," she said, certainty settling in her chest like a cold stone. "Something sudden and violent that left them unable to move on. But it's not feeding on the laylines like the Rowan tree was. They're just... stuck."

Tobi strummed a soft, questioning melody on his lute, and Lin was surprised to see one of the ghostly figures pause in its endless pacing to turn toward the sound. For a moment, features resolved themselves from the pale mist—a young woman's face, marked with desperate longing and terrible sadness.

"Music draws them," Lin realized. "They're still connected to the living world somehow. That's why they can't pass on—they're anchored here by something unfinished."

Willi finished her interviews and approached with the notebook tucked under one arm. "Pattern is consistent across all witnesses," she reported. "The spirits appear most solid at dawn and dusk, fade to near-invisibility during full daylight. They react to sound, especially voices, but flee from any attempt at direct contact."

"Classic signs of traumatic haunting," Greta agreed. "They're reliving their final moments over and over, trapped in the emotional echo of whatever killed them." Her hand rested on her sword hilt, but Lin could tell it was habit rather than preparation for battle. "The question is whether they died here, or if their bodies lie elsewhere but their spirits were drawn to this place by some connection we don't yet understand."

The afternoon wore on as they studied the phenomenon, and Lin began to see patterns in the spirits' movements. They didn't pace randomly—each ghost followed a specific route across the bridge, some heading north to south, others moving in the opposite direction. At certain points, they would stop and reach toward the water, their faces showing expressions of desperate searching.

As the sun began its descent toward the western hills, the spirits became more solid, their movements more frantic. Lin could now make out details of their clothing—travel cloaks, sturdy boots, the practical garments of people who'd been journeying when whatever happened to them occurred.

"Merchants or pilgrims," she murmured, watching a ghostly man in a leather coat repeatedly examine something in his translucent hands. "A group of travelers, caught by something they couldn't escape."

The breakthrough came as true dusk approached and the spirits reached their most solid manifestation. Lin was close enough to the bridge's edge to hear what might have been voices, faint as whispers carried on the wind. She strained to make out words, and finally caught fragments of what sounded like desperate conversation:

"—the rope, find the rope—"
"—too deep, can't reach—"
"—baby's crying, where's the baby—"

Lin's blood turned to ice water as understanding crashed over her. "They're not the ones who died," she said, her voice barely above a whisper. "They're the ones who lived. They're trying to save someone who's still down there."

She pointed toward the water beneath the bridge's central arch, where the current ran deepest and swiftest. "There's someone in the river. Someone they couldn't save, and they're trapped here trying to finish the rescue."

Greta was on her feet immediately, striding toward the bridge with purpose that made her armor ring like bells. "Then we finish what they started," she declared. "No soul should be lost when help is possible, whether they draw breath or not."

But as they approached the haunted span, the temperature plummeted so rapidly that their breath came out in white puffs. The ghostly figures turned toward them with expressions of wild hope and terror, reaching out with translucent hands as if begging for help with an impossible task.

Lin felt the weight of their desperation pressing against her consciousness, seven souls trapped in an endless loop of attempted rescue, searching for someone who'd been beyond their reach for however long they'd been bound to this place. The question now was whether she could give them the closure they needed to finally let go, or if she was about to become the eighth spirit trapped on the Silberbach bridge.
