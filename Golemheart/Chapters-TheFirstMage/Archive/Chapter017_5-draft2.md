# Chapter 17.5: Preparing for the Journey - Draft 2

The Academy's workshop felt different with Astrid Ironweaver examining every detail like she was pricing it for sale. Lin watched the northern woman trace protective runes with knowing fingers, her weathered face showing approval for craftsmanship that most visitors couldn't even recognize.

"Solid work," Astrid said, testing the stability of a brewing station. "Your Library Spirit understands the balance between safety and functionality."

"Safety being relative," Tobi commented, gesturing at scorch marks decorating one wall. "Lin's experiments tend to be... ambitious."

"Ambition builds knowledge," Astrid replied, but her attention had shifted to something that made Lin's stomach tighten. "Though I'm curious about this resonance I'm feeling."

The antler staff in Astrid's satchel had begun its soft singing again, the musical tones now harmonizing with something beneath the Academy in a way that made the air itself feel charged. Lin's blackthorn staff responded with subtle vibrations that she could feel through her palm.

"The artifacts are getting stronger," Lin observed, unable to keep worry from her voice. "Every day the singing gets clearer."

"Because they're awakening to their true purpose," Astrid said seriously. "But that presents us with a problem. How long do you think we can keep awakening magical artifacts secret in a place where every surface is covered with detection enchantments?"

The question hit like cold water. Lin looked around the workshop with new eyes, noting the subtle glows that indicated monitoring spells, protective wards, and automatic alerts built into the Academy's security systems.

"We can't," Greta said, her tactical mind immediately grasping the implications. "Every day we delay increases the risk of discovery."

"Discovery by who?" Willi asked practically, though her tone suggested she already suspected the answer wouldn't be pleasant.

"Imperial investigators who classify singing artifacts as possible demonic corruption," Astrid replied grimly. "Church officials who forbid magical practices that don't require divine blessing. Guild administrators who demand registration and control of all powerful magical tools."

"Wonderful," Tobi said with false cheer. "So we're harboring contraband that gets more obvious by the hour."

"Which is why I need to return to the Wild Lands soon," Astrid continued. "The question is whether you're coming with me."

The directness of her offer created a silence that stretched until Lin could hear her own heartbeat mixing with the artifacts' musical resonance. She felt her friends processing implications that would change everything about their carefully planned Academy careers.

"What exactly would that involve?" Greta asked, her strategic instincts demanding specifics before any commitments.

"A journey into territories where the old knowledge is preserved," Astrid replied. "Places where you could learn techniques that Academy training can't provide. But also regions where Imperial law doesn't apply and survival depends on understanding social dynamics your education hasn't covered."

"How long?" Willi asked, always focused on practical considerations.

"Weeks, possibly months," Astrid admitted. "The Wild Lands don't operate on Academy schedules."

"And the risks?" Greta pressed.

"Everything from hostile wildlife to clan politics to magical phenomena that conventional training doesn't prepare you for," Astrid said honestly. "But the alternative is staying ignorant while the world's magical infrastructure continues deteriorating around you."

As if summoned by her words, shouting erupted from the Academy's main entrance. Through the workshop windows, Lin could see Guild messengers arriving with the kind of urgent energy that meant serious problems somewhere.

"Another magical disaster," Astrid observed, reading the signs with experienced eyes. "How many is that this month?"

"Too many," Lin replied, remembering the reports of layline corruption, failed spells, and magical accidents that seemed to be increasing weekly.

They made their way to the Academy's main hall, where Guild representatives were briefing administrators about a catastrophic magical failure in the border city of Grenzfeld. The details that emerged made Lin's blood run cold.

"Complete layline corruption across three city blocks," the messenger was explaining. "Academy mages attempted standard purification protocols, but the corruption just spread. They're evacuating the entire settlement."

"Evacuation protocols are in place," Master Korven replied with the kind of calm that suggested he was deeply worried. "What's the current containment status?"

"Failing," the messenger admitted. "The corruption is advancing approximately fifty meters per day. At current rates, it will reach the next major settlement within a week."

"Standard Academy techniques aren't working?" Greta asked quietly, though she already knew the answer.

"Standard techniques are making it worse," Astrid murmured. "Academic magic tries to impose order on corruption, but that just gives it more structure to spread through."

"You're saying the old knowledge could handle this?" Lin asked, her pulse quickening with a mixture of hope and determination.

"I'm saying the old knowledge was designed specifically for problems like this," Astrid replied. "Corruption happens when magical flow gets twisted. Traditional healing methods work with natural patterns instead of fighting them."

The evening found them gathered in Lin's workshop again, this time without Astrid, facing a decision that would reshape their entire futures. The conversation started cautiously but quickly escalated as the implications became clear.

"It's a chance to learn techniques that might actually solve these problems," Lin said, gesturing toward the direction of Grenzfeld. "Instead of just containing them until they get worse."

"It's also abandoning Academy protection to venture into territories where we could disappear without a trace," Greta countered, though her tone suggested she was weighing options rather than dismissing the idea.

"Academy protection hasn't been particularly effective lately," Tobi pointed out. "We've been handling crises that supposedly required senior mages."

"Because we work well together here," Willi said. "But teamwork in controlled environments doesn't guarantee survival in chaos."

"True," Lin admitted. "But staying safe also means staying helpless when the next magical disaster happens."

Greta leaned forward, her strategic mind engaging with the problem. "If we go, we need clear objectives and contingency plans. This can't be an open-ended adventure."

"Agreed," Willi said. "We need to know what we're trying to learn and how we'll know when we've learned enough to return."

"Also communication protocols," Tobi added. "Some way to get word back if we discover something critical."

Lin felt a warmth spreading through her chest as she watched her friends shift from questioning the idea to planning how to make it work. This was their four-way dynamic at its best—each person contributing their natural perspective to transform a wild possibility into an achievable goal.

"So we're actually considering this," she said, hardly believing they'd moved so quickly from curiosity to commitment.

"We're considering it because the alternative is watching problems get worse while pretending our current knowledge is sufficient," Greta replied. "Which it clearly isn't."

"Plus," Tobi added with a grin that didn't entirely hide his nervousness, "when do you get the chance to learn magic that supposedly doesn't exist?"

"That's exactly what worries me," Willi said, but she was already pulling out paper to start making lists. "If we do this, we need supplies, equipment, and some way to explain our absence."

The planning session continued past midnight, covering everything from travel logistics to equipment modifications. But underneath the practical concerns, Lin sensed something deeper—a shared recognition that they'd outgrown the Academy's ability to prepare them for the challenges they were facing.

"Extended research leave," Greta suggested when they discussed administrative requirements. "Collaboration with northern clan practitioners on layline healing techniques."

"Think they'll approve it?" Tobi asked.

"Given the current crisis level, they might be desperate enough to try anything," Willi observed pragmatically.

The next morning brought validation for Willi's assessment. Master Korven listened to their carefully prepared proposal with the attention of someone facing problems that conventional solutions couldn't address.

"You understand this would be unofficial research," he said carefully. "The Academy cannot provide institutional support for techniques that fall outside established magical frameworks."

"We understand," Greta replied formally. "But we also understand that established frameworks aren't solving current problems."

"True," Master Korven admitted with obvious reluctance. "Very well. Extended research leave approved, but you'll be representing Academy interests. Your actions reflect on our institution's reputation."

"We'll remember that," Lin promised, though she suspected they'd soon be operating in contexts where Academy reputation mattered less than survival.

The next few days passed in a blur of preparation that revealed how much they'd grown since their early Academy days. Instead of standard Guild equipment, they packed specialized tools adapted to their individual strengths and collaborative methods.

Lin spent hours brewing potions in concentrated forms that would travel well, her workshop filling with vials of healing draughts, stamina enhancers, and experimental formulations she'd never had reason to test. Her blackthorn staff received additional protective enchantments, while her herb collection expanded to include specimens that conventional botany couldn't explain.

"This feels like we're preparing for war," she commented, watching Willi organize their supplies with military precision.

"Maybe we are," Willi replied seriously, balancing weight considerations against the reality that resupply might be impossible. "Just not the kind of war they teach you about in Academy courses."

Tobi upgraded his equipment to include tools for information gathering and social navigation, recognizing that survival in the Wild Lands would depend as much on reading people correctly as handling magical threats. His enhanced reflexes from Lin's stamina potion had faded, but the experience had shown him possibilities for magical augmentation that conventional training didn't cover.

"You realize we're about to become that story other students tell," he said while testing the balance on a new set of throwing knives. "The ones who disappeared chasing forbidden knowledge."

"Better than being the ones who stayed safe while everything fell apart," Greta replied, adjusting the fit of armor modified for extended travel. Her faith in the Light had expanded to encompass concepts that Church doctrine didn't traditionally address, but her commitment to protecting people remained unwavering.

The night before departure, they shared dinner with Academy friends and faculty who wished them well while clearly thinking they were making a dangerous mistake. The conversations carried warmth mixed with uncertainty about when or whether they would return.

"Remember that knowledge grows through exploration," Master Korven said during his farewell toast, "but wisdom requires knowing when to return home."

"We'll remember," Lin promised, though she suspected that what they learned might change their definition of home in ways none of them could predict.

As dawn broke over Eisenstadt, they met Astrid at the northern gates. The morning mist seemed charged with possibility, but also with warnings about challenges that academic preparation couldn't address.

"Any last-minute regrets?" Astrid asked, studying their faces for signs of hesitation.

Lin looked at her friends—Greta checking their route one final time, Willi distributing trail rations with characteristic efficiency, Tobi making jokes to hide his nervousness—and felt the familiar warmth of knowing they were facing the unknown together.

"No regrets," she said firmly. "Just curiosity about what we're going to discover."

"Then let's find out what the old knowledge has to teach," Astrid said with satisfaction, leading them toward territories where ancient secrets waited to be rediscovered by those brave enough to seek them.
