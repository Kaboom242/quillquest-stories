# Chapter 14: Evernight at Rowan Hollow - Draft 1

The road to Rowan Hollow stretched ahead like a ribbon of pale stone, but something was wrong with the light. Lin pulled her cloak tighter as she noticed the sun hanging motionless in the sky, casting the same dusky shadows it had been casting for the past hour. The air carried an odd stillness that made her skin prickle with unease.

"Anyone else notice we've been traveling in the same twilight for three hours?" Tobi asked, his usual smirk replaced by a frown of concentration. He gestured at the unchanging shadows with his lute case. "Sun hasn't moved a finger's width since we left the main road."

Greta shifted in her saddle, one hand resting on her sword hilt. "The Light preserve us. This feels like cursed ground." Her voice carried none of its usual dramatic flair, just genuine concern that made Lin's stomach tighten.

As they crested a small hill, Rowan Hollow spread before them like a painting frozen in time. Smoke rose from chimneys in perfectly straight columns that never dispersed, and Lin could see villagers moving through the streets in repetitive patterns that made her eyes water to follow. A man with a cart full of turnips passed the same corner three times while she watched, each time turning to call out to a woman hanging laundry who responded with identical gestures.

"They're trapped," Willi said softly, her usual warmth replaced by professional analysis. "Some kind of temporal loop. Look at their movements—too precise, too repetitive." She pointed to where a child was skipping down the same path over and over, never seeming to tire or change direction.

Lin dismounted and pressed her palm against her blackthorn staff, feeling the Forest Spirit stir with agitation. She extended her awareness toward the laylines that should flow beneath the village, but what she sensed made her gasp and stumble backward. The magical currents weren't flowing at all—they writhed and twisted like wounded snakes, knotted into painful spirals that pulsed with an unhealthy red tinge.

"The laylines are damaged," she said, her voice tight with growing alarm. "Something's tangling them up, forcing them into these awful knots. I can barely make sense of the patterns." She tried to trace the source of the distortion, but the magical currents kept shifting and writhing, making it impossible to get a clear reading.

They made their way into the village carefully, watching the villagers continue their endless loops. A baker carried the same tray of bread past his shop window five times while Lin counted, and two merchants argued about harvest prices with exactly the same words and gestures, their voices rising and falling in identical rhythms.

"Excuse me," Greta called to an elderly woman sweeping her doorstep. "Can you tell us what day it is?"

The woman looked up with glassy eyes. "Harvest day, dearie. Always harvest day here in Rowan Hollow. Been a good season, praise the Light." She returned to her sweeping with mechanical precision, each stroke of the broom following the exact same arc.

Lin felt a chill that had nothing to do with the stagnant air. The woman's words echoed strangely, as if she were reciting lines from a play she'd performed too many times. Around them, the village continued its eerie pantomime of normalcy, every movement scripted by whatever force held them prisoner.

A low, haunting sound drifted through the air—part hum, part whisper, carrying undertones that made Lin's teeth ache. It seemed to come from everywhere and nowhere, but when she listened carefully, she could tell it was strongest toward the ancient forest that bordered the village's northern edge.

"That sound," she said, pointing toward the dark treeline. "Whatever's causing this, it's coming from the forest. The laylines are all twisted up in that direction." She closed her eyes and let her staff guide her awareness, following the knotted magical currents toward their source.

The forest loomed ahead of them like a wall of shadows, its entrance barely visible through a curtain of darkness that seemed to swallow light itself. Strange whispers echoed from between the trees, and Lin caught glimpses of movement that disappeared the moment she tried to focus on them. Shadow-shapes flitted between the trunks, and the very air near the forest edge shimmered with an oily, unnatural quality.

"Well," Tobi said, his voice carefully casual, "that's not ominous at all. Mysterious forest of shadows calling to us? What could possibly go wrong?" Despite his joking tone, Lin noticed he'd moved closer to Greta's horse, seeking the comfort of numbers.

"The spirits around the entrance are agitated," Lin said, pressing deeper with her magical senses. "They're not malicious, just... frightened. Something in there has them running in circles, too confused to even approach us properly." She could feel them clustering at the forest's edge, small presences that sparked with panic and uncertainty.

They dismounted and approached the treeline cautiously. The moment they drew near, the shadows seemed to recoil, pulling back from their torches like living things. Lin held up her staff and whispered a gentle greeting to the spirits she sensed nearby, but they scattered like startled birds, leaving only confused chirping sounds in their wake.

"Normal light isn't going to work in there," Lin realized, studying the way their torches barely penetrated the supernatural darkness. "Those spirits are in too much distress to help us, and I can't read the laylines properly with all this interference." She bit her lip, thinking hard. "I need to make something new. A tool that can see both spirits and laylines clearly, even in corrupted places like this."

"What kind of tool?" Willi asked, already reaching into her herb pouch with the practical efficiency Lin had come to appreciate.

"A Spirit-lantern," Lin said, the idea crystallizing as she spoke. "I'll need to etch spirit-runes onto a focus crystal, then convince a small spirit to partner with it. When I breathe Hearthflame into the whole thing, it should be able to show us what we can't see normally." She looked around at her friends. "But it's going to drain me significantly, and I'll need help gathering the materials."

Tobi grinned, his usual mischief returning. "Lucky for you, I have an excellent eye for shiny things." He produced a small, clear crystal from his pack—probably something he'd 'found' during their last adventure. "Will this work?"

Willi was already sorting through her herbs. "Lavender for calming, sage for clarity, and..." She pulled out a small vial of silvery powder. "Moonstone dust. It should help stabilize whatever you're planning to do." Her movements had the confidence of someone who'd supported magical experiments before.

Greta positioned herself between Lin and the forest, sword half-drawn. "I'll watch for anything that tries to interrupt. Work quickly—this place makes my skin crawl." Her usual theatrical posturing was gone, replaced by the practical vigilance of a professional warrior.

Lin settled cross-legged on the ground and began the delicate work of etching spirit-runes onto Tobi's crystal. The symbols had to be perfect—each curve precisely placed to create pathways for spiritual energy to flow. She used her smallest etching stylus, the one her grandmother had given her, and felt the familiar tingle of magic responding to her careful work.

"Little spirits," she whispered as she worked, "I'm not trying to trap anyone. I just need a partner to help guide my friends and me. Someone small and brave who wants to help solve the trouble here." She kept her voice gentle and inviting, hoping one of the agitated spirits might be curious enough to approach.

A tiny spark of light drifted down from the trees—barely larger than a firefly, pulsing with nervous energy. Lin held very still as it circled the crystal, investigating her work with careful interest. "Hello there," she said softly. "Would you like to help us fix whatever's wrong in your forest?"

The spirit bobbed once, then settled onto the crystal with a sound like a tiny bell. Lin smiled and continued her etching, incorporating the spirit's energy into the rune-work. She could feel its willingness to help, tinged with fear about whatever lurked deeper in the woods.

When the etching was complete, Lin cupped the crystal in both hands and took a deep breath. "This is going to hurt," she warned her friends, then deliberately opened her inner flame and breathed a stream of golden Hearthflame into the crystal. The effort left her gasping and shaky, but the crystal began to glow with a soft, steady light that was somehow easier on the eyes than their torches.

The Spirit-lantern revealed things their normal vision had missed entirely. Laylines became visible as twisted ribbons of sickly red light, all leading deeper into the forest. Small spirits clustered around the trees like frightened children, and Lin could see paths through the darkness that hadn't been there before. But most unsettling of all, she could see the wrongness—dark knots in the laylines that pulsed with malevolent energy, all centered around something hidden in the forest's heart.

"It's definitely coming from the center," she said, hanging the lantern from her staff where it cast its revealing light ahead of them. "The laylines are all twisted around something ancient. Something that's been feeding on the village's time." She took an unsteady step forward, still drained from creating the lantern.

As they entered the forest, the Spirit-lantern attracted immediate attention. Curious spirits emerged from hiding—tucklings with bark-like skin and bright eyes, rootlings that looked like tiny mobile trees, and shadow-wisps that danced around the light like moths. Some seemed friendly, clustering around Willi when she offered them crumbs of herb-bread, but others hung back with obvious suspicion.

The forest paths shifted constantly, but the Spirit-lantern's glow showed them the true way forward. Whenever they started to go in circles, the light would pulse and point them toward passages that led deeper into the woods. The little spirit inside the lantern chimed softly whenever they needed to change direction, its fear gradually giving way to determination as they moved closer to the source of the corruption.

But Lin noticed Greta growing more tense with each step into the shadows. The normally confident knight kept glancing over her shoulder, and her breathing had become shallow and quick. When a branch cracked overhead, she nearly drew her sword before catching herself.

"Greta?" Lin asked quietly, hanging back while Tobi and Willi continued ahead. "Are you all right?"

Greta's jaw clenched, and for a moment Lin thought she wouldn't answer. Then, in a voice barely above a whisper: "I hate the dark. Always have, since I was small. Father used to lock me in the castle's wine cellar when I misbehaved, and I..." She shook her head sharply. "It's foolish. A knight should fear nothing."

"It's not foolish," Lin said firmly. "Fear keeps us careful. And you're still here, still protecting us, even though you're scared. That's not weakness—that's courage." She adjusted the Spirit-lantern so it cast more light around Greta. "Besides, we need you watching our backs. Who else is going to notice if something tries to sneak up on us?"

Tobi had overheard and dropped back to walk beside Greta, his lute already in his hands. He began playing a soft, cheerful melody—nothing dramatic or attention-grabbing, just the kind of tune that made darkness seem less oppressive. "You know," he said conversationally, "I once spent three days hiding in a grain cellar from some very angry merchants. Terrible place for someone who doesn't like small, dark spaces. But you know what got me through it? Remembering that darkness is just the absence of light, not the presence of evil."

Greta managed a small smile. "When did you become so wise?"

"Must be all the time I spend with Lin," Tobi grinned. "Wisdom is apparently contagious. Who knew?"

Willi had stopped ahead of them, herb-smoke drifting from her hands as she calmed a cluster of agitated rootlings. "The spirits are getting more distressed," she called back. "Whatever's at the center of this, we're getting close."

The Spirit-lantern's light revealed their destination: a clearing where an enormous Rowan tree stood like a dark sentinel. Its trunk was easily twenty feet across, and its bark was carved with symbols that seemed to shift when Lin wasn't looking directly at them. The laylines converged here in a tangled knot of red-tinged energy that made Lin's eyes water, and ghostly images flickered in the air around the tree—fragments of memories that played and replayed like broken recordings.

But the tree itself was wrong. Its bark was blackened as if by fire, and its branches drooped with an exhaustion that seemed to seep into the very air around it. The Spirit-lantern revealed the truth: laylines weren't just twisted here, they were being consumed by something buried beneath the tree's massive roots. Something that fed on time itself, growing stronger with each moment it stole from the trapped village.

Lin approached the tree carefully, her Spirit-lantern casting its revealing light across the damaged bark. The little spirit inside chimed anxiously, but didn't try to flee. Together, they were going to have to find a way to heal whatever corruption had taken root in this ancient place, before it consumed not just Rowan Hollow, but everything else the spreading temporal distortion could reach.

The Rowan's spirit was in agony, Lin realized as she touched the bark. It had been fighting this corruption for decades, holding it back through sheer will and the strength of its ancient roots. But it was losing the battle, and when it finally fell, the corruption would spread beyond anything they could contain.

"We need to help it," she said, her voice filled with determination despite her exhaustion. "This tree has been protecting everyone, holding back something terrible all by itself. It's time we gave it some support."

The Spirit-lantern pulsed with agreement, and Lin felt the small spirit's courage strengthen her own. Whatever they faced in the darkness beneath the Rowan's roots, they would face it together, as partners rather than master and tool. It was, after all, the witch way.
