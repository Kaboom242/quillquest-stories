# Chapter 21: Songs of Memory

Lin woke to Greta's armor creaking in the pre-dawn darkness, her friend sitting bolt upright with the sharp intake of someone escaping nightmares. The sound cut through the grove's morning quiet like steel against stone.

"Easy, Gret," Tobi's voice came from where he was coaxing their fire back to life, twigs crackling as flames caught. "Just dreams."

"Were they, though?" Greta's voice carried the rough edges of sleepless wrestling with theological crisis. "Every time I closed my eyes, I heard that bureaucratic language. 'Pilot zone for pagan remediation.' How do you call systematic cultural murder a nightmare when it's documented policy?"

Lin felt the familiar ache of watching her friend's world crack apart. She reached over to squeeze Greta's gauntleted hand, metal cold but the grip beneath it desperately human.

"Because it's still horrible," she said simply. "Doesn't matter if it's policy or nightmare—it's still wrong."

Willi looked up from checking their gear, her movements steady despite the exhaustion that shadowed all their eyes. "At least now we know why the Academy was so insistent that 'primitive practices' were inherently unreliable. Hard to question authority when you're taught to dismiss any evidence that contradicts it."

"Speaking of evidence," Tobi said, glancing toward where Korren was approaching through the morning mist, "looks like today's lesson is starting."

Korren led them deeper into the grove's heart, where seven ancient oaks formed a natural amphitheater. Lin felt the magical atmosphere shift as they walked—not the broken struggle of yesterday's damaged circle, but something that hummed with accumulated power and careful cultivation.

"Different," she murmured, letting her senses explore the energy patterns threading between massive trunks.

"Six centuries different," Korren confirmed, settling cross-legged beneath the largest oak with practiced familiarity. Her weathered hands found bark patterns worn smooth by generations of contact. "Yesterday you saw destruction. Today you'll learn why your Church fears memory magic above all other traditional practices."

Lin watched Greta's breathing quicken at the mention of Church fears. Yesterday's revelations about systematic persecution were still raw, theological foundations cracking along fault lines that had been building since they'd first witnessed the broken circle.

"Memory magic?" Willi asked, her practical mind already working through implications. "But the Academy taught us that preserved memories were inherently unreliable. Too much human distortion for historical accuracy."

"Convenient, right?" Tobi snorted, his street-smart instincts recognizing institutional manipulation from a mile away. "Can't have actual evidence contradicting whatever story serves current political needs."

"More than convenient," Korren replied with grim satisfaction. "Essential for maintaining institutional control." She pressed both palms against the ancient bark, and Lin felt the grove's atmosphere thicken. The air itself seemed to hold its breath, weighted with accumulated truth. "This grove remembers six hundred years of clan gatherings. Not interpretations or summaries, but complete truth of what actually happened."

Lin's magical understanding recoiled from the implications. "Six hundred years of unedited historical records? The political ramifications alone..."

"Exactly why Church doctrine dismisses memory magic as 'primitive superstition,'" Korren said. "Hard to rewrite history when people can access actual memories of events."

"But how do you verify accuracy?" Greta asked, her strategic training emerging despite spiritual turmoil. "What prevents contamination from false memories or deliberate deception?"

"The trees themselves." Korren's hands moved across bark with unconscious reverence. "Living wood resonates with truth in ways human consciousness can't fake. Try to preserve deliberate lies, and the grove rejects the recording entirely."

"Natural fact-checking," Lin realized, the magical mechanics becoming clear. "The magic itself prevents historical manipulation."

"Which makes it the Church's absolute worst nightmare," Tobi observed with dark satisfaction. "Truth that can't be controlled, rewritten, or conveniently forgotten."

"Want to hear what 'Peaceful Integration of the Northern Clans' actually sounded like?" Korren asked, pressing deeper against the oak's trunk.

Lin felt the air around them begin to vibrate as the tree responded. Then voices filled the grove—not echoes or reconstructions, but actual preserved conversations carrying all the emotional weight of their original context.

"...Church representatives assured us that territorial autonomy would be completely respected under voluntary spiritual oversight arrangements..."

The formal cadences of treaty negotiation made Lin's stomach clench. These weren't stories about the past—they were the past itself, speaking with voices of people who'd believed they were protecting their families.

"...but the written contract specifies Church authority to modify traditional practices for 'theological compatibility.' That's not what they promised verbally..."

"...they're lying while documenting our consent to our own elimination..."

The voices faded, leaving them sitting in grove air heavy with preserved betrayal. Lin watched Greta's face drain of color as the full scope of systematic deception became undeniable.

"When?" Greta whispered.

"Forty-three years ago," Korren replied. "Your Church calls it successful voluntary integration. The grove remembers it as documented fraud."

"Jesus," Tobi breathed. "How many other 'voluntary agreements' were pure manipulation?"

"Would you like to hear what Church officials really said when they thought no one was recording?" Korren asked quietly.

Lin felt Greta's grip tighten on her hand. Her friend was wrestling with duty versus dread—needing truth but terrified of what she might learn.

"Show us," Greta said finally, her voice carrying the kind of determined honesty that had made her worthy of knighthood.

New voices filled the air, and these spoke with casual cruelty that made Lin's magical senses recoil in horror.

"...these primitive practices will disappear within a generation if we're systematic about elimination. Remove children for 'education,' disrupt traditional cycles, ensure the next generation associates ancestral ways with shame and ignorance..."

"...regional command wants plausible deniability. Document everything as 'voluntary modernization.' History will remember us as enlightened progress facilitators, not civilization destroyers..."

Lin felt bile burning her throat. The preserved voices carried callous calculation of people discussing cultural genocide as administrative procedure. She could see identical horror spreading across her friends' faces—recognition that these weren't rogue officials but standard policy implementation.

"Stop," Greta said abruptly, her voice breaking. "Please, just stop."

"Hey." Tobi moved closer with the gentle efficiency he'd learned on streets where showing weakness invited predators, but offering comfort kept friends alive. "You're okay. We've got you."

"No, I'm not okay," Greta replied with stark honesty that cut through the grove's heavy atmosphere. "How can I be okay? Everything I believed about serving spiritual truth..."

"Is getting tested against actual reality," Willi finished, her practical mind working through implications with characteristic directness. "And reality's winning."

Lin shifted to put her arm around Greta's armored shoulders, feeling her friend's tension like a bowstring ready to snap. "The Light still guides truth, Gret. Maybe it's just that the Church stopped following where the Light actually leads."

"But how can I tell the difference anymore?" Greta's voice carried anguish that went bone-deep. "If systematic oppression gets presented as divine service, how do I know what I'm actually serving?"

"Same way you always have," Tobi said with street-smart wisdom. "Look at what actions actually do to people. What did this do to families like Madern's?"

The question hung in the grove like smoke while they processed together, their combined understanding deeper than any individual could reach alone.

"Can you show recent memories?" Lin asked, needing to keep moving before Greta's crisis overwhelmed them all. "Information about the magical disruptions we've been hearing about?"

"If they were preserved here," Korren replied carefully. "What are you looking for?"

"Connections between infrastructure destruction and current magical failures," Lin said, pressing her palm against ancient bark.

The tree's response hit immediately—not voices this time, but collective fear carried in preserved memory. Recent gatherings where clan elders shared reports of magical failures across territories, desperate discussions about traditional protections no longer functioning, terrified speculation about foundational magic continuing to collapse.

"They know," she said, pulling back from contact with profound accumulated worry. "Traditional practitioners understand the magical disruptions aren't random events. The infrastructure destruction is causing systematic breakdown."

"Infrastructure the Church has been deliberately eliminating for generations," Korren added with bitter accuracy.

"Wait." Willi's practical mind made connections with characteristic speed. "If they've been destroying magical foundations for decades, and now abilities are failing everywhere..."

"Then the disasters aren't accidents," Lin realized, pieces clicking together with horrible clarity. "They're consequences of systematic infrastructure destruction."

"The grove can show you Church authorities discussing exactly those possibilities," Korren said quietly. "Officials who understood the risks and decided political control was worth potential magical catastrophe."

"Show us," Greta said with growing determination. "If I'm going to serve the Light properly, I need to understand exactly what darkness I've been supporting."

The new voices that filled the grove spoke with clinical detachment that chilled Lin's blood.

"...seventeen traditional power sites successfully eliminated in northern territories. Local practices should become impossible within five years..."

"...theological advisors warn that destroying foundational infrastructure might destabilize magical systems beyond our control..."

"...political necessity outweighs magical considerations. Traditional practices represent existential threats to Church authority. Better to risk instability than permit organized resistance to institutional control..."

The conversation ended, leaving them processing institutional calculation that valued political power over magical stability.

"They knew," Greta said, her voice hollow with recognition of systematic betrayal. "Church leadership understood that destroying traditional infrastructure might cause exactly these disasters, and decided the political benefits justified the risks."

"That's how institutions think," Tobi said grimly. "Short-term political gains, long-term catastrophic consequences. Always someone else's problem when bills come due."

"So what can we actually do?" Willi asked with practical directness. "Infrastructure's destroyed, knowledge scattered, systems collapsing."

"Not all lost," Lin said slowly, understanding taking shape in her mind. "Knowledge is preserved in places like this. Infrastructure can potentially be rebuilt. If traditional practitioners could coordinate efforts..."

"To restore what was systematically destroyed," Greta finished, her strategic mind engaging despite spiritual crisis. "Rebuild infrastructure and recover knowledge before collapse becomes irreversible."

"That would make us heretics by Church law," Willi pointed out.

"Then we're heretics," Greta replied with quiet conviction that surprised them all. "Because serving the Light means serving truth, not institutional control that destroys truth to maintain power."

"You sure about this, Gret?" Tobi asked gently. "Going up against the Church isn't exactly a safe career move."

"Neither is watching the world burn while I follow orders from people who started the fire," Greta replied, reaching for Lin's hand again. "Some things are worth the risk."

As they prepared to leave the grove, Lin watched Greta kneel before the ancient oak, pressing her palm against bark with the reverence of someone seeking guidance from powers older and more trustworthy than the institutions she'd served.

When her friend stood, Lin saw fundamental change in her expression. The Knight of the Light remained, but now she served Light that valued truth over institutional control and ancient wisdom over political convenience.

It was transformation that would change everything about their journey through the Wild Lands, and everything about what they might do when they returned to territories where Church law held absolute authority.

The real work was just beginning.
