# Chapter 22: Sea-Witch Wards - Draft 1

The coastal settlement of Salzwind clung to rocky cliffs like barnacles on a ship's hull, its weathered buildings connected by rope bridges that swayed in the constant ocean breeze. Lin breathed deeply as they approached the harbor, taking in the salt air and the complex symphony of creaking wood, calling gulls, and waves crashing against the harbor walls.

"Impressive engineering," Greta observed, noting how the town's layout took advantage of natural wind patterns and tidal flows.

"And serious maritime culture," Willi added, watching fishing boats return with their day's catch while children ran along the docks with practiced ease on the wet planking.

"Perfect place for learning about ship magic," Tobi said cheerfully. "Sailors always have the best stories about strange encounters and protective charms."

Lin studied the boats in the harbor with growing fascination. Every vessel, from the smallest fishing skiff to the largest merchant ship, bore carved symbols along their hulls. The patterns looked similar to the memory runes they'd learned from Bjorn, but adapted for different purposes and environments.

"The carvings are everywhere," she observed, noting how the symbols seemed to follow specific placement patterns along waterlines and prow sections.

"Traditional blessing work," explained a gruff voice behind them. They turned to find a weathered shipwright approaching, his hands stained with wood shavings and what looked like protective oils. "Name's Henrik Saltson. You're the folks asking about the old hull markings?"

"We are," Lin replied, showing him Bjorn's letter of introduction. "The skald mentioned you might know about sea-witch wards."

Henrik examined the letter carefully before nodding with approval. "Bjorn's word carries weight here. Aye, I know the ward patterns—learned them from my father, who learned from his. But the power's been gone from them for generations."

"Gone how?" Willi asked practically.

"Just stopped working," Henrik replied with a shrug. "The carvings look right, the placement follows tradition, but storms still sink ships and sea beasts still attack. Folks keep having the blessing ceremonies because it's what we've always done, but most figure it's just superstition now."

"What if it's not superstition?" Lin asked. "What if the wards just need proper activation?"

Henrik's eyes sharpened with interest. "You think you can make them work again?"

"I'd like to try," Lin said. "If you're willing to let me examine one of the carved hulls."

"More than willing," Henrik said enthusiastically. "If there's a chance the old protections could work again, every sailor in Salzwind would want to know about it."

He led them to a medium-sized fishing vessel called the "Storm Rider" that bore particularly elaborate carvings along its hull. The symbols were similar to what Lin had seen in Bjorn's memory runes, but with differences that suggested adaptation for marine environments.

"These patterns are fascinating," she said, running her fingers along the carved lines. "They're designed to channel power through the wood grain itself."

"Makes sense for a ship," Greta observed. "The hull needs to remain structurally sound while channeling magical forces."

"Plus boats face different threats than land-based magic," Tobi added. "Storms, sea monsters, navigation challenges—the wards would need to address multiple problems."

Lin closed her eyes and reached out with her magical senses, feeling for any trace of dormant power in the carvings. Like Madern's bone work, she could sense potential waiting to be awakened, but the patterns felt incomplete somehow.

"There's something here," she said slowly. "But it's not just the carvings that matter. The wards need something else to function properly."

"What kind of something else?" Willi asked.

"I'm not sure yet," Lin admitted. "Henrik, what do the traditional blessing ceremonies involve?"

"Salt water, ritual words, offerings to the sea spirits," Henrik replied. "Same ceremonies my grandfather performed, though he claimed they used to be more elaborate."

"More elaborate how?"

"Blood offerings, he said. And special oils made from sea plants. Plus the ceremonies used to be performed during specific tidal conditions when the ocean's power was strongest."

Lin studied the carved symbols with new understanding. "It's not just the hull magic—it's a combination of multiple elements working together. The carvings, the ritual components, and the timing all contribute to creating effective protection."

"Like a complex spell that requires multiple components," Greta said, grasping the concept immediately.

"Exactly. But instead of reagents and incantations, it uses physical symbols, natural timing, and ritual offerings to channel protective power."

"Can you recreate the complete ritual?" Henrik asked hopefully.

"I can try," Lin said. "But we'll need to gather the proper materials and wait for the right tidal conditions."

"What kind of materials?" Willi asked, already thinking about logistics.

"Sea plants with magical properties," Lin replied. "Salt collected during storm tides. And we'll need to understand what the blood offerings actually accomplished in the original rituals."

"Blood offerings sound potentially dangerous," Greta warned.

"Not necessarily," Tobi said thoughtfully. "Many protective rituals use small amounts of blood to create sympathetic connections. The danger comes from how much and in what context."

Henrik nodded approvingly. "You understand more than most landlubbers. The old ceremonies used just a few drops from the ship's captain, mixed with storm-salt and kelp oil."

"To create a personal connection between the ship and its protector," Lin realized. "The blood links the captain to the wards, making them respond to the vessel's specific needs."

"And the sea plants provide the interface between human magic and ocean forces," Willi added, following the logic.

"While the storm-salt channels the sea's own protective power," Greta concluded.

"You learn fast," Henrik said with growing excitement. "When can we attempt the full ritual?"

Lin consulted the small tide charts Henrik provided. "The next storm tide is in three days. That should give us time to gather materials and prepare properly."

"I'll spread word among the other shipwrights," Henrik said. "If this works, every boat in the harbor will want the proper wards activated."

"Let's start with one ship and see what happens," Lin said cautiously. "We need to understand how the magic works before attempting larger applications."

Over the next three days, they gathered the necessary components under Henrik's guidance. Storm-salt proved surprisingly difficult to collect, requiring specific timing and location to capture salt that had been charged by lightning-struck waves. The sea plants needed to be harvested during low tide when their magical properties were most concentrated.

"This is considerably more complex than Academy magic," Willi observed as they prepared the ritual oils according to Henrik's traditional recipes.

"Because it works with natural forces rather than trying to control them," Lin replied, grinding kelp fronds with careful attention to the specified patterns. "The magic has to harmonize with ocean rhythms instead of imposing artificial structures."

"More like what we learned at the stone circle," Greta said, understanding the connection to other old magical traditions they'd encountered.

"Exactly. All these techniques seem to share the principle of working with existing power sources rather than forcing magic through predetermined channels."

When the storm tide arrived, Lin found herself standing waist-deep in churning seawater while Henrik held the Storm Rider steady against the dock. The ritual required her to touch each carved symbol while channeling power through the specially prepared oils and storm-salt mixture.

"The patterns are activating," she called over the sound of wind and waves. Silver light began to trace the carved lines as her magic found proper channels through the prepared materials.

"Something's happening to the water around the hull," Tobi observed, noting how the waves seemed to part more smoothly around the ship's bow.

"The wards are taking hold," Henrik said with amazement. "I can feel the difference in how she sits in the water."

Lin continued the activation process, moving from symbol to symbol as the ritual components created connections between her magic, the carved patterns, and the ocean's natural forces. The work was exhausting but exhilarating, like conducting a complex orchestra where every instrument was a different type of magical energy.

"It's working," she gasped as the final symbol flared to life. "The hull is fully warded now."

"How can we test the protection?" Greta asked practically.

"Carefully," Henrik replied. "But I know a reef that's claimed three boats this year. If the wards work, the Storm Rider should be able to navigate it safely."

"Are you sure that's wise?" Willi asked. "What if the wards fail at a critical moment?"

"Then we'll know they don't work," Henrik said with sailor's pragmatism. "But if they do work, we'll have proven the old magic can be restored."

The test sail that followed provided dramatic proof of the wards' effectiveness. The Storm Rider moved through dangerous waters with impossible grace, the hull wards deflecting rocks and guiding the vessel safely through passages that should have been treacherous.

"Incredible," Greta breathed as they returned to harbor. "The ship handles like it's being guided by invisible hands."

"The wards create a protective field around the hull," Lin explained, exhausted but exhilarated by the successful demonstration. "They deflect physical threats and provide navigation assistance based on the ocean's own knowledge of safe passages."

"This could save hundreds of lives," Henrik said with deep gratitude. "How soon can we ward the rest of the fishing fleet?"

"That depends on how quickly we can train other people to perform the activation ritual," Lin replied. "The process is too complex and draining for one person to handle multiple ships."

"Plus we need to consider the implications of widespread ward activation," Willi added thoughtfully. "If every ship in the region suddenly becomes storm-proof, it could affect trade patterns and naval strategies."

"One step at a time," Tobi suggested. "Let's focus on teaching the technique to local shipwrights and letting them decide how quickly to implement it."

As they prepared to leave Salzwind, Lin reflected on what they'd accomplished. The sea-witch wards represented another piece of the larger pattern they'd been discovering—ancient magical techniques that worked by harmonizing with natural forces rather than imposing artificial control.

"We're beginning to understand how all these old traditions connect," she said to her friends as they watched the Storm Rider prepare for another test voyage. "Memory preservation, bone magic, stone circle wisdom, and now ship wards—they all share similar principles."

"Working with existing power instead of forcing it," Greta agreed.

"Respecting natural rhythms and cycles," Willi added.

"And preserving knowledge through practical application rather than theoretical study," Tobi concluded.

"The question is what we do with this understanding," Lin said thoughtfully. "These techniques could revolutionize how magic is practiced, but they also challenge everything the academies teach about proper spellcraft."

Walking away from the harbor with the sound of waves and rigging filling the salt air around them, Lin carried with her not just new magical knowledge, but a growing sense that they were uncovering something much larger than individual techniques—a complete alternative approach to magic that had been suppressed and nearly lost, but might hold the key to solving problems that conventional spellcraft couldn't address.
