# Chapter 14: Evernight at Rowan Hollow - Draft 2

The road to Rowan Hollow wound through countryside that should have been bathed in afternoon sunlight, but Lin's shadow had been pointing in the same direction for over an hour. She stopped her horse and squinted at the sun, which hung motionless in a sky the color of old amber. The air tasted stale, like breath held too long.

"The light's wrong," she said, pressing her palm against her blackthorn staff. The Forest Spirit within stirred uneasily, its consciousness brushing against hers with wordless concern. "Time's... stuck somehow."

As they crested the hill overlooking Rowan Hollow, Lin felt her stomach drop. The village spread below them like a child's toy set, smoke rising from chimneys in perfectly straight columns that never dispersed. She watched a man with a cart of turnips pass the same corner, turn, call out "Fresh turnips! Best of the season!" to a woman hanging laundry, who waved back with an identical gesture. Thirty seconds later, he passed the same corner again. Same words. Same wave.

Lin's mouth went dry. She'd seen magical anomalies before, but nothing like this. The wrongness of it made her skin crawl, as if she were watching people trapped in a living nightmare they couldn't escape.

"Guild posting," Greta said grimly, pointing to a weathered notice board at the village outskirts. Her usual dramatic flair was completely absent, replaced by the focused attention of a professional who recognized serious danger. "Academy investigation required. Potential layline artifact recovery. All findings must be reported." She read the formal language with distaste. "Bureaucrats."

Lin dismounted and approached the village cautiously, extending her awareness toward the laylines that should flow beneath Rowan Hollow like golden rivers. What she touched made her gasp and stumble backward as if she'd grabbed a red-hot poker. The magical currents weren't flowing at all—they writhed and twisted in agonizing knots, pulsing with an ugly red tinge that spoke of corruption and pain.

"The laylines," she breathed, clutching her staff for support. "They're not just damaged, they're... screaming." The sensation was like hearing a chorus of voices crying out in agony, all twisted together into patterns that made no sense. Every time she tried to trace the source, the threads shifted and convulsed, refusing to hold still long enough for proper reading.

They spent the next hour documenting the temporal boundaries, mapping exactly how far the effect extended. Lin discovered that the loops weren't perfectly uniform—some villagers repeated longer cycles than others, and a few seemed caught in micro-loops that lasted only minutes. The baker carried his tray past the same window seventeen times while she counted, each identical journey taking exactly three minutes and forty seconds.

Willi approached an elderly woman sweeping her doorstep. "Excuse me, could you tell us what's happening here?"

The woman looked up with eyes that seemed to see through them. "Harvest day, dear. Always harvest day in Rowan Hollow. Been blessed with such fine weather, praise the Light." She returned to sweeping with mechanical precision, each stroke covering the exact same patch of stone.

"How long has it been harvest day?" Willi pressed gently.

"Why, today of course! Such a lovely harvest day. Been blessed with fine weather..." The woman's voice took on the hollow quality of an echo, and she began the exact same sweeping pattern again.

Lin felt sick. These people weren't just trapped in time—they were slowly losing themselves, becoming nothing more than recordings playing the same moments over and over. How long before they forgot who they were entirely?

A low humming drifted across the village, barely audible but persistent. It seemed to come from everywhere at once, but Lin noticed it grew stronger when she looked toward the ancient forest that bordered the village's northern edge. The sound made her teeth ache and her vision blur slightly, as if reality itself was slightly out of focus.

"There," she said, pointing toward the dark treeline. "Whatever's causing this is in the forest. The laylines are all knotted up in that direction." She closed her eyes and let her staff guide her awareness, following the twisted magical currents toward their source like following a painful thread through a labyrinth.

The forest entrance was barely visible through curtains of shadow that seemed to absorb light. As they approached, Lin caught glimpses of movement—shadow-shapes that flickered between the trees, always disappearing when she tried to focus on them. The very air near the forest edge rippled like heat waves, and whispers echoed from between the trunks in languages she didn't recognize.

"The spirits here are panicking," Lin said, extending her magical senses cautiously. She could feel them—dozens of small presences clustering around the forest's edge, too frightened and confused to approach properly. "They're not hostile, just... terrified. Something in there has them all running in circles."

Tobi held up his torch and frowned when the light barely penetrated a few feet into the supernatural darkness. "Well, that's not ominous at all. Forest of living shadows that eat light? I'm sure it's perfectly safe." Despite his joking tone, Lin noticed he'd moved closer to Greta's horse.

"Normal torches won't work in there," Lin realized, studying how the shadows seemed to recoil from their flames like living things. "And I can't read the laylines properly with all this interference. The spirits are too distressed to help guide us." She bit her lip, mind racing. "I need to make something new. A tool that can see both laylines and spirits clearly, even in corrupted places."

"What kind of tool?" Willi asked, already reaching for her herb pouch with practiced efficiency.

"A Spirit-lantern." The idea crystallized as Lin spoke, pieces of half-remembered lessons from her grandmother clicking into place. "I'll need to weave spirit-threads around a focus, then convince a small spirit to partner with the whole thing. When I charge it with Hearthflame, it should reveal what normal sight can't see."

Lin settled cross-legged on the ground and pulled out her supplies—silk thread that shimmered with its own faint luminescence, a small crystal Tobi produced from his 'collection,' and her grandmother's etching stylus. The work required absolute precision. Each thread had to be woven in specific patterns, creating pathways for spiritual energy to flow through the crystal matrix.

"I need spirit-silk for the base," she murmured, beginning the delicate weaving. The threads were gossamer-thin and tried to drift away if she breathed too hard. "Then layering patterns to channel both spiritual and layline energies without them interfering with each other."

Willi arranged her herbs in a protective circle—lavender for calming, sage for clarity, rosemary for remembrance. "Take your time," she said softly. "I'll keep the local spirits from getting too curious while you work."

Greta positioned herself between Lin and the forest, sword loose in its sheath. "Work quickly. This place makes every instinct I have scream warnings." Her usual theatrical posturing was gone, replaced by the practical vigilance of someone who'd learned to trust her intuition about danger.

The weaving took nearly an hour. Lin's fingers cramped from the precise work, and sweat beaded on her forehead despite the cool air. Each spirit-thread had to be anchored to specific points on the crystal, then woven through patterns her grandmother had taught her but never fully explained. She was working from intuition and half-remembered stories, hoping the magic would recognize her intent even if her technique wasn't perfect.

"Little spirits," she whispered as she worked, keeping her voice gentle and inviting. "I'm not trying to trap anyone. I need a partner—someone brave and clever who wants to help solve the trouble here. Someone small enough to live comfortably in a crystal but strong enough to guide us through the darkness."

A tiny spark of light drifted down from the trees—no larger than her thumbnail, pulsing with nervous energy. Lin held perfectly still as it circled the crystal, investigating her work with cautious interest. She could sense its curiosity warring with fear.

"Hello there," she said softly. "Would you like to help us fix whatever's hurting your forest? I promise we'll be partners, not master and servant. You can leave anytime you want."

The spirit bobbed once, then settled onto the crystal with a sound like a tiny bell. Lin smiled and continued weaving, incorporating the spirit's energy into the thread patterns. She could feel its willingness to help, tinged with deep worry about whatever lurked in the forest's heart.

When the weaving was complete, Lin cupped the finished lantern in both hands and took a deep breath. This was the dangerous part—breathing Hearthflame into another being required absolute trust and considerable personal cost. "This is going to hurt," she warned her friends.

She opened her inner flame carefully, feeling the warm golden energy that lived at her core. Then, with deliberate control, she breathed a stream of pure Hearthflame into the crystal. The effort was like giving away part of her own life force—the world suddenly felt colder, colors became less vivid, and exhaustion hit her like a physical blow.

But the Spirit-lantern blazed to life with soft, steady radiance that was somehow easier on the eyes than normal flames. Lin hung it from her staff with trembling hands, too drained to stand immediately.

The lantern revealed things their torches had completely missed. Laylines became visible as twisted ribbons of sickly light, all flowing toward the forest's heart like streams converging on a whirlpool. Small spirits clustered around the trees—tucklings with bark-like skin and bright worried eyes, rootlings that looked like mobile saplings, shadow-wisps that danced nervously in the lantern's glow. Most unsettling of all, she could see the wrongness itself: dark knots in the laylines that pulsed with malevolent hunger, feeding on something hidden deep in the forest.

"It's definitely coming from the center," Lin said, still catching her breath from the Hearthflame expenditure. "Something ancient and hungry. The laylines are all being drawn toward it like water down a drain." She managed to stand, leaning heavily on her staff. "But at least now we can see where we're going."

As they approached the forest entrance, the Spirit-lantern attracted immediate attention from the local spirits. They emerged from hiding with cautious curiosity—creatures Lin had only heard about in her grandmother's stories. Tucklings peered at them from behind tree trunks, their wooden faces expressing worry mixed with hope. Rootlings gathered around Willi when she offered them crumbs of herb-bread, chittering gratefully in voices like rustling leaves.

But there were hostile spirits too. Shadow-wisps that tried to extinguish their torches, and something larger that stayed just beyond the lantern's reach, growling warnings in a language that bypassed the ears and spoke directly to the hindbrain's fear centers.

"The path ahead is true," the little spirit in the lantern chimed, its voice like silver bells. "But danger waits where the great tree grieves. Ancient hunger stirs. Ancient pain calls for healing."

Lin nodded grimly. Whatever they found in the forest's heart, it would require all her skill and more courage than she was sure she possessed. But the Spirit-lantern pulsed with steady encouragement, and she felt the small spirit's determination strengthen her own resolve.

"Together then," she whispered to her ethereal partner. "Let's go heal something that's been broken for far too long."

The Spirit-lantern's glow pushed back the supernatural darkness just enough to reveal a winding path that led deeper into the trees. Behind them, Rowan Hollow continued its endless harvest day, trapped in loops that grew tighter with each repetition. Ahead lay whatever ancient corruption had been feeding on the village's stolen time, growing stronger with each moment it consumed.

Lin took a deep breath, gathered her remaining strength, and stepped into the haunted woods. The real work was about to begin.
