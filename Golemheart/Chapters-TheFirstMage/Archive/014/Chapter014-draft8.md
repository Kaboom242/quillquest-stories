# Chapter 14: Evernight at Rowan Hollow - Draft 3

The road to Rowan Hollow wound through countryside that should have been bathed in afternoon sunlight, but Lin's shadow stretched in the same direction it had for over an hour. She stopped her horse and stared at the sun, which hung motionless in a sky the color of old amber. Her mouth tasted of copper and stale air, as if she'd been holding her breath.

"Time's broken here," she whispered, pressing her palm against her blackthorn staff. The Forest Spirit within recoiled from whatever wrongness filled the air, its ancient consciousness touching hers with wordless alarm. The sensation made her stomach lurch—like hearing a beloved song played horribly off-key.

As they crested the hill overlooking Rowan Hollow, Lin's heart sank. The village spread below them like a music box with a broken spring, every movement precise but meaningless. Smoke rose from chimneys in perfectly straight columns that never dispersed, and she watched a man with a cart of turnips pass the same corner exactly every three minutes and forty seconds. "Fresh turnips! Best of the season!" he called to a woman hanging laundry, who waved back with an identical gesture each time.

Lin counted seventeen repetitions before she had to look away. These weren't just people trapped in time—they were slowly disappearing into their own echoes, losing more of themselves with each repetition.

"Guild posting," Greta said grimly, pointing to a weathered notice board at the village outskirts. Her usual theatrical presence was subdued, professional instincts taking over. "Academy investigation required. Potential layline artifact recovery. All findings must be reported." She read the bureaucratic language with obvious distaste. "They'll want to study this place until there's nothing left to save."

Lin dismounted and extended her awareness toward the laylines that should flow beneath Rowan Hollow like underground rivers. The moment her consciousness touched them, agony shot through her skull like lightning. She cried out and stumbled, clutching her staff as waves of wrongness crashed over her senses. The laylines weren't flowing—they convulsed like wounded animals, twisted into knots that pulsed with sick red light. Every pulse felt like a scream of pain transmitted directly into her bones.

"They're not just damaged," she gasped, pressing her free hand to her temple where a vicious headache was building. "The laylines are being tortured. Something's feeding on them, knotting them up on purpose." She tried to trace the source, but the magical currents writhed away from her touch like things in agony, refusing to hold still long enough for proper reading.

They spent the next hour mapping the temporal boundaries with methodical care. The loops weren't uniform—some villagers repeated cycles lasting minutes, others hours. The baker carried his tray past the same window in precise three-minute intervals, while a pair of children played the same game of catch for exactly twelve minutes before starting over. Lin documented each pattern, her heart breaking a little more with every repetition. How long before these people forgot who they were entirely?

Willi approached an elderly woman sweeping her doorstep with mechanical precision. "Excuse me," she said gently, crouching down to the woman's eye level. "Can you tell us what day it is?"

The woman looked up with eyes that seemed to see through them. "Harvest day, dear. Always harvest day in Rowan Hollow. Been blessed with such fine weather, praise the Light." She returned to sweeping, each stroke covering the exact same three-foot patch of stone.

"How long has it been harvest day?" Willi pressed, her voice carrying the patient warmth she used when coaxing frightened children.

"Why, today of course! Such a lovely harvest day. Been blessed with..." The woman's voice became hollow, echoing, as she began the exact same sweeping pattern. Her movements were losing their humanity, becoming more mechanical with each repetition.

A low humming drifted across the village—barely audible but persistent, like a chord played on broken strings. Lin felt it in her teeth, in the hollow of her bones. The sound grew stronger when she looked toward the ancient forest that bordered the village's northern edge, and she realized the humming matched the rhythm of the twisted laylines' convulsions.

"There," she said, pointing toward the treeline. "Whatever's doing this is in the forest. All the corruption flows that direction." She closed her eyes and let her staff guide her awareness, following the knotted magical currents like following a thread through a maze of thorns.

The forest entrance loomed ahead, but as they approached, Lin saw they weren't alone. Dozens of spirits clustered around the treeline—but not the friendly woodland sprites she expected. These spirits were agitated, panicked, blocking the forest paths with their small bodies and chittering warnings in voices like breaking glass.

"Turn back! Turn back!" squeaked a tuckling, its bark-skin mottled with stress patterns. "Great hunger wakes! Old promises break! No passage for warm-bloods!"

More spirits emerged—rootlings that normally tended forest growth now twisted their branches into barrier patterns, and shadow-wisps darted between the trees like warning flags. They weren't hostile, Lin realized. They were terrified, trying to protect them from something that had traumatized the entire forest ecosystem.

"They're not going to let us pass," Lin said, studying the wall of frightened spirits. "They're too scared of whatever's in there to risk letting anyone through." She extended her magical senses carefully, trying to understand their panic without adding to it. What she felt made her shiver—a wrongness so deep it had poisoned the very idea of safety in this place.

"What do scared spirits need?" Willi asked softly, already reaching into her herb pouch. But instead of pulling out ingredients, she knelt and began humming—a lullaby Lin remembered from childhood, simple and soothing. The melody seemed to ease some of the spirits' panic, their chittering becoming less frantic.

Greta stepped forward and placed her hand solemnly over her heart. "By the Light that guides all good souls," she said formally, "I swear we come not as conquerors but as healers. We seek to mend what has been broken, to ease the pain that drives good spirits to desperation." The words carried the weight of genuine conviction, and several spirits stopped their frantic blocking motions to listen.

Tobi sat on a fallen log and pulled out his lute, his usual mischievous grin replaced by quiet focus. "Hey, little ones," he said gently, beginning to play a soft melody that complemented Willi's humming. "We've seen broken things before. Sometimes they can be fixed, if someone cares enough to try. Will you let us try?"

Lin stepped forward slowly, keeping her movements peaceful and deliberate. "I can see how much pain you're all in," she said to the spirits. "The laylines are screaming, aren't they? Whatever's in there is hurting everything connected to the forest." She held up her hands, showing she carried no threatening tools. "We want to help. We want to make the screaming stop."

The spirits wavered, their panic slowly giving way to desperate hope. A brave rootling approached Lin's outstretched hand, touching her finger with one tiny branch. The contact let her feel what they felt—terror so deep it had become part of the forest's heartwood, and underneath that, a terrible grief for something ancient and beloved that had been corrupted beyond recognition.

"Oh," Lin breathed, tears stinging her eyes. "You're trying to protect us from something you love. Something that's been twisted into something terrible." She knelt among the spirits, letting them sense her genuine desire to heal rather than harm. "Will you trust us to try? Will you let us attempt to heal what's been broken?"

The spirits clustered together, communicating in whispers too fast and high for human ears. Finally, the brave rootling spoke for all of them: "Warm-bloods may pass. But beware—great tree grieves beyond healing. Ancient hunger grows beyond stopping. Old friend becomes old enemy, and we cannot save what will not be saved."

The wall of spirits parted reluctantly, creating a narrow path between the trees. But as they stepped across the threshold, Lin felt something shift in the air—a heaviness that pressed against her lungs and made her skin crawl. The temperature dropped noticeably, and shadows seemed to move independently of any light source.

"This place feels wrong," Greta muttered, one hand drifting to her sword hilt. Her voice carried an edge Lin had rarely heard before—not fear exactly, but deep unease. "The darkness here isn't natural."

"Normal torches won't work in there," Lin realized, watching their flames sputter and dim as supernatural shadow pressed against them. "And I can't read the laylines properly with all this interference. The corruption is too strong." She bit her lip, considering options. "I need to make something new. A tool that can see both laylines and spirits clearly, even in places this poisoned."

"What kind of tool?" Willi asked, moving to stand closer to Lin with protective instincts taking over her usual nurturing impulses.

"A Spirit-lantern," Lin said, the solution crystallizing from half-remembered lessons. "I'll need to weave spirit-threads around a focus crystal, then convince a small spirit to partner with the device. When I charge it with Hearthflame, it should reveal what normal sight can't penetrate."

The work was delicate and draining. Lin settled cross-legged on the forest floor and pulled out her supplies—silk thread that shimmered with its own faint luminescence, a small crystal from Tobi's collection, and her grandmother's etching stylus. Each thread had to be woven in precise patterns, creating pathways for spiritual energy to flow through the crystal matrix without interference.

"I need perfect concentration," she warned her friends. "And someone to watch for anything that might interrupt. This magic requires partnership, not force—one wrong move and I could hurt the spirit I'm trying to work with."

Willi arranged protective herbs in a careful circle, then settled beside Lin to provide steady emotional support. Greta positioned herself facing the forest, sword loose but ready, while Tobi kept his lute in hand to soothe any spirits drawn by the magic.

The weaving took nearly an hour of painstaking work. Lin's fingers cramped from the precise movements, and sweat beaded on her forehead despite the cool air. Each spirit-thread had to be anchored to specific points on the crystal, then woven through patterns that would channel both spiritual and layline energies without them interfering with each other.

"Little spirits," she whispered as she worked, keeping her voice gentle and inviting. "I need a partner—someone brave enough to help guide us through this corruption. Someone who wants to heal the pain that's poisoning your home."

A tiny spark of light drifted down from the branches above—no larger than her thumb, pulsing with nervous energy but also curiosity. Lin held perfectly still as it circled the crystal, investigating her work with careful attention. She could sense its internal struggle between fear and hope.

"Hello there," she said softly. "I promise we're partners in this. You can leave anytime, and I'll never try to command you. We're just asking for your help to see clearly in dark places."

The spirit settled onto the crystal with a sound like tiny wind chimes. Lin smiled and continued weaving, incorporating its energy into the thread patterns. She could feel its willingness to help, mixed with deep worry about whatever waited in the forest's heart.

When the weaving was complete, Lin cupped the finished lantern in both hands and took a steadying breath. "This is going to cost me," she warned her friends. "Hearthflame isn't meant to be given away lightly."

She opened her inner flame with careful deliberation, feeling the warm golden energy that lived at her core—the part of her that was most essentially herself. Then, with an act of will that felt like tearing off a piece of her soul, she breathed a stream of pure Hearthflame into the crystal. The world immediately felt colder and more distant, colors draining from her vision as exhaustion hit like a physical blow. She swayed and would have fallen if Willi hadn't caught her shoulders.

But the Spirit-lantern blazed to life with soft, steady radiance that seemed to warm the air around them. The little spirit inside chimed contentedly, its fear transforming into determination now that it had a purpose and protection.

"Thank you," Lin whispered to her ethereal partner, hanging the lantern from her staff with trembling hands. "Now let's see what we're really dealing with."

The lantern's light revealed a transformed landscape. Laylines became visible as ribbons of sickly red energy, all flowing toward the forest's heart like blood drawn toward an open wound. Small spirits clustered around the trees—not the healthy woodland sprites they should be, but creatures driven to distraction by pain they couldn't escape. Most disturbing of all, she could see the corruption itself: dark veins running through everything, pulsing with hungry malevolence that made her stomach turn.

"Something's feeding," she said, her voice barely above a whisper. "Not just consuming the laylines, but actively twisting them. Making them hurt on purpose." The lantern's light showed paths through the supernatural darkness, but also revealed how deep the corruption ran. This wasn't random magical damage—it was deliberate torment.

As they prepared to enter the forest proper, the Spirit-lantern attracted more attention from the local spirits. They emerged from hiding with desperate hope, creatures Lin had only heard about in her grandmother's stories. Tucklings with faces like carved wood but eyes full of too-human pain. Rootlings whose branches trembled with exhaustion from fighting corruption that poisoned their very roots. Shadow-wisps that flickered between visibility, too hurt to maintain solid form.

But there were hostile presences too—things that had been spirits once but were now something else, twisted by prolonged exposure to whatever malevolence lay ahead. They stayed just beyond the lantern's reach, but Lin could feel their attention like cold breath on the back of her neck.

"The path ahead leads to great sorrow," the spirit in the lantern chimed, its voice like silver bells touched with sadness. "Ancient friend sleeps in pain, dreams in hunger. Old promises break like autumn leaves. We will try to heal, but healing may require sacrifice we are not prepared to make."

Lin nodded grimly, understanding more than she wanted to. Whatever waited in the forest's heart had once been something good—something the local spirits had loved and trusted. Now it was a source of corruption and pain, but they still hoped it could be saved rather than destroyed.

"Together then," she whispered to her luminous partner. "Let's go see if we can save something that's been lost for too long."

The Spirit-lantern's glow pushed back just enough darkness to reveal a winding path deeper into the trees. Behind them, Rowan Hollow continued its endless harvest day, each repetition stealing a little more humanity from the trapped villagers. Ahead lay whatever ancient corruption had been feeding on the village's stolen time, growing stronger and more twisted with each moment it consumed.

Lin gathered her remaining strength and stepped forward into the haunted woods, her friends close behind. The real work of healing was about to begin, and she had no idea if her partnership-based magic would be enough to mend something so deeply broken.
