The massive Rowan tree's presence crashed over Lin like a wave of liquid sorrow, ancient grief so thick she could taste it—metallic and bitter, like blood mixed with tears that had been crying for centuries. Her knees nearly buckled as the tree's consciousness pressed against her mind, and she had to grip her staff with both hands to stay upright.

Through the Spirit-lantern's trembling light, she watched dark veins pulse beneath the bark like infected arteries, each throb sending that nauseating hum through her bones. The corruption wasn't just magical—it was emotional, raw agony given form and allowed to fester until it had become something hungry and desperate.

A sound emerged from the tree that made Lin's chest constrict with sympathetic pain. Not quite a groan, not quite a sob, but something that belonged to both categories and neither. The voice that formed in her mind felt like touching a wound that had never been allowed to heal: _Help... me... cannot... stop..._

"It's still conscious," Lin whispered, stepping closer despite her body's desperate urge to flee. "I can feel it trying to speak, but the corruption is like—like screaming over a whisper."

Before anyone could respond, the tree pulsed again and reality fractured around them. Lin suddenly experienced every second of the past two weeks compressed into a single, agonizing moment. She felt the tree's slow descent into madness, the gradual poisoning of every layline connection, the helpless horror of watching the village trap itself in endless loops while being unable to stop feeding on their temporal energy. When the vision released her, she was on her knees in the forest loam, retching.

Willi's hands found her shoulders, steadying but not restraining. "What did you see?"

"The dungeon break," Lin gasped, wiping her mouth with a shaking hand. "When the Academy's wards failed, the magical feedback traveled through every layline for miles. But this tree was already weakened—I think by simple old age and isolation. The shock pushed it over the edge."

The tree shuddered at her words, and she felt another spike of its consciousness touch hers—not words this time, but pure emotion. Desperate, clawing fear at the thought of death, but underneath that, something worse: the fear of being forgotten, of having all its centuries of protection and care erased by this final act of corruption.

"It doesn't want to die," Lin said, tears she didn't remember shedding hot on her cheeks. "It remembers being a guardian. Centuries of sheltering spirits, protecting travelers, helping things grow. It's terrified that all of that will be lost if we have to destroy it."

Tobi moved closer, and Lin could hear his breathing change as the tree's emotional weight hit him too. His usual easy grin had vanished, replaced by something softer and more serious than she'd ever seen from him. When he spoke, his voice was gentle as rain on new leaves.

"Hey there, ancient one," he said, pulling his lute into position. "You've been hurting for a long time, haven't you?" The melody he began was nothing like his usual cheerful songs—this was something that sounded like forgiveness, like the promise that pain doesn't last forever.

The tree's agonized groaning softened slightly as the music washed over it, and Lin felt some of the violence go out of the pulsing corruption. But she could see it wasn't enough. The darkness ran too deep, had too many years to take root.

"I need to use Threadcraft," she said, though the thought of working such delicate magic so close to so much corruption made her stomach clench. "Not to force it back to health—I don't think that's possible. But maybe I can help it remember what it chose to be, before the pain made it forget."

She approached the tree's base where the corruption was thickest, each step feeling like walking through cold honey that tried to pull her down. When she placed her palm against the twisted bark, agony shot up her arm like lightning made of broken glass. She bit her tongue hard enough to taste blood, but held the connection, reaching deeper with her magical senses.

There. Buried beneath layers of accumulated anguish and twisted magic, she found what she was looking for—a tiny seed of the tree's original nature, still pure, still remembering its purpose. But reaching it would mean diving through all that corruption, exposing herself to the same madness that had claimed the tree.

Willi knelt behind her without being asked, pressing one warm palm against Lin's back right over her heart. "I'm here," she said simply. "Breathe with me when you get lost."

Lin felt Greta's presence at the edge of the clearing, solid and protective as a stone wall. The knight's voice carried the weight of absolute conviction: "I'll watch for the corruption trying to spread. If I say retreat, you listen."

Tobi's music shifted, becoming something that felt like a rope of light cast into dark water. "Follow the melody if you can't find your way back," he called softly. "I'll keep playing until you're home."

Lin closed her eyes and let her consciousness sink into the tree's mind.

The corruption hit her like being thrown into a maelstrom of liquid madness. Centuries of accumulated pain crashed over her in waves—every moment of confusion, every flash of rage, every second of helpless hunger as the tree consumed the very things it had once protected. She felt herself beginning to dissolve into the ancient guardian's anguish, losing track of where Lin ended and the tree began.

But Willi's hand was an anchor, warm and steady as a heartbeat. Tobi's music was a lifeline, weaving through the chaos like golden thread. And ahead, through the storm of corruption, she could sense that tiny spark of the tree's true self.

The Threadcraft she began weaving wasn't meant to heal or repair—it was meant to remember. Each thread she laid down carried a specific memory of what the tree had been: the guardian who had grown a canopy of shelter for three lost children during the worst blizzard in living memory. The ancient friend who had hummed lullabies to frightened sprites when storms broke their courage. The patient teacher who had helped saplings learn to root deep and grow strong.

The corruption fought back viciously, trying to twist her memories into nightmares of failure and abandonment. Each thread she placed, the darkness tried to corrupt with visions of every traveler who had died despite the tree's protection, every storm that had been too strong, every time caring hadn't been enough.

But Lin held firm to the moments of light. She wove the memory of lovers carving their initials into bark that healed around the wounds like a blessing. She spun threads of spring mornings when the tree's song had called birds back from their winter homes. She anchored every stitch with the truth that choosing to care, even when it hurt, was what made someone a guardian.

The breakthrough came like a dam bursting. The tree's consciousness suddenly blazed with recognition, washing away the corruption like sunlight burning off fog. The dark veins pulsing through the bark began to fade, and the agonized groaning transformed into something that sounded almost like laughter—old and tired, but genuine.

Lin opened her eyes to find the tree transformed. Silver-gray bark gleamed in the Spirit-lantern's light, and healthy leaves rustled with the sound of contentment. The air no longer tasted of pain and metal, but of growing things and morning dew.

"Thank you," the tree's voice whispered in her mind, clear as a bell and warm as summer honey. "I remember now. I remember what I am."

The restoration spread outward from the tree like dawn breaking, and Lin felt it happening through every connection she'd woven. Corrupted spirits throughout the forest suddenly straightened as centuries of pain lifted from their small shoulders. The oppressive darkness dissolved, replaced by the soft silver light of a healthy forest evening.

In the distance, she could hear voices from Rowan Hollow—confused calls, then shouts of joy as people realized they could move freely again, that tomorrow was finally coming.

Lin leaned back against the tree's trunk, exhausted but smiling as the ancient guardian's contentment flowed through her like warm wine. The Spirit-lantern in her hand chimed once, happily, as the little spirit inside felt the forest's return to health.

"Is it finished?" Greta asked, and Lin could hear the knight's relief in the way her armor creaked as tension finally left her shoulders.

"It's finished," Lin confirmed, looking up at the tree's canopy where spirits were beginning to emerge from hiding, their small faces bright with wonder. "The guardian remembers itself, and the laylines are flowing clean again."

As they prepared to leave the clearing, the tree's voice touched her mind one last time: "The village will need watching. What happened here has weakened the barriers between worlds. I will stand guard as I always have, but strange things may slip through in the coming months. Will you remember to check on us?"

Lin pressed her palm against the bark once more, sealing the promise. Their work here was finished, but the connections they'd forged would need tending for years to come. That was the nature of healing—it created new responsibilities, new threads that bound communities together.

They walked back through the healthy forest in comfortable silence, following paths lit by natural moonlight filtering through leaves that whispered with contentment. Behind them, the ancient guardian settled into its watch, once again the protector it had always been meant to be.
