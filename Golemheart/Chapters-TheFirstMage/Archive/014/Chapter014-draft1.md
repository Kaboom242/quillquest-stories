Joachim Brenner’s boots left muddy crescents on the Academy’s marble floor, each step a protest against the order and certainty of the world he’d come to disrupt. He paused, hat in hand, before Dean Margarethe’s desk, his voice trembling with urgency. “It’s the orchard, ma’am. The trees—they’re moving. Apples vanish from the baskets, and there’s whispering in the night. Old words. Words my grandfather feared.”

Margarethe’s lips pressed into a thin line. “Superstition, Mr. Brenner. Trees don’t walk, and fruit doesn’t vanish.”

Joachim’s hands shook. “Three villages depend on my harvest. If this curse isn’t lifted, they’ll starve. The other farmers are talking about burning the orchard.”

Lin Xiu leaned forward, eyes bright. “Did you see any layline patterns? Glowing threads, maybe?”

Joachim blinked. “I saw something. Like veins in the earth, pulsing. I’ve never seen anything like it.”

Greta stepped forward, her armor catching the last rays of afternoon sun. “We protect the innocent. We’ll investigate.”

Margarethe hesitated, then nodded. “Very well. But be careful. If this is a layline disturbance, it could be dangerous.”

The party set out, the weight of winter’s promise pressing behind them. Tobi whistled a tune, lute slung over his shoulder. Willi carried a basket of offerings, her face set in determined lines.

The orchard greeted them with a silence that felt deliberate, as if the trees themselves were holding their breath. Lin unfolded Joachim’s map, but the neat rows of apple trees had become a labyrinth, trunks standing where none should be. The air shimmered with the tension of displaced magic. Lin knelt, pressing her palm to the earth, and the layline beneath writhed—a living current in pain.

Greta scanned the horizon, hand on her sword. “Stay close. I don’t like this.”

Lin called on her staff, coaxing it into a lantern that spilled gentle light across the tangled roots. Spirits flickered in the glow, translucent forms drifting between trees, their faces lost and searching.

Willi whispered, “They’re afraid. I can feel it.”

The moment Lin’s light touched them, the spirits recoiled, vanishing deeper into the orchard. Branches creaked, reaching not in threat but in longing.

Tobi grinned, trying to lighten the mood. “Maybe they just want a good story.”

Greta’s hand found Lin’s shoulder, guiding her back. “We need a new approach. They’re not angry, just… lost.”

Twilight pressed in, and the party realized they would need a different approach before the orchard’s confusion became chaos.

As the sky deepened to indigo, Willi set a basket at the orchard’s heart—herbal tea steaming, honey cakes glistening, and autumn fruits arranged with reverence. She spoke softly, words of respect drifting on the breeze. “We come in peace. We bring gifts. Please, let us help.”

The first to emerge were flower spirits, their forms delicate and trembling, followed by root sprites who clung to Willi’s skirt. They shared their distress in waves of emotion: fear, confusion, longing for a guardian who had vanished since the earth-shaking that had scarred the land.

Lin knelt beside Willi, voice gentle. “Can you show us where it hurts?”

A root sprite pointed with a tiny, trembling hand toward the oldest tree at the orchard’s heart. Lin followed, senses open, feeling the ache in the laylines.

Greta kept watch, eyes scanning for danger. “If something scared the guardian, it must be powerful.”

Tobi crouched beside a flower spirit, voice soft. “Did you see a fox? Silver, with bright eyes?”

The spirit nodded, shivering. “It plays tricks. It laughs at our pain.”

Night settled, and the orchard’s restlessness grew. Tobi slipped away from the group, his steps light on leaf-littered ground. He found the source of the mischief—a silver fox with eyes too bright for any earthly creature, darting between trees and rearranging apples with gleeful abandon.

Tobi strummed his lute, voice playful. “You like chaos, don’t you?”

The fox paused, ears twitching. “Sadness is boring. I make things interesting.”

Tobi sat cross-legged, playing a gentle tune. “Sometimes, sadness needs a friend, not a prank.”

The fox’s tail flicked, uncertainty rippling through its form. “You’re different. You listen.”

Tobi smiled. “If you help us, I’ll tell you a story you’ve never heard.”

The fox considered, then nodded. “I’ll stop. For now.”

With the fox’s mischief stilled, Lin returned to the heart of the orchard. She drew threads of magic from the air, weaving connections between wandering spirits and the trees they belonged to. Her fingers moved with purpose, each knot a promise of healing.

Greta knelt beside Lin, voice steady. “You can do this. We’re here.”

Willi placed a hand on Lin’s back, warmth flowing through her touch. “Let the spirits guide you.”

The guardian spirit watched from the shadows, drawn by the gentle demonstration. When it finally emerged, its form was vast and ancient, eyes reflecting centuries of growth and memory. Its voice was fractured, trembling. “I am broken. The earth-shaking severed my bonds. I cannot protect them.”

Lin’s heart ached. “Let me help. I’ll weave your threads anew.”

The guardian hesitated. “It is dangerous. You may lose yourself.”

Greta’s grip tightened on Lin’s shoulder. “We won’t let you go.”

Willi whispered, “Trust yourself. Trust us.”

Tobi played a melody, soft and steady. “We’re with you, Lin.”

Lin closed her eyes, reaching into the guardian’s memories. She saw spring blossoms, autumn harvests, storms that shattered branches, festivals under lantern light, moments of loss and regrowth. The rhythm of seasons pulsed through her, threatening to drown her own thoughts.

Greta’s voice cut through the haze. “Lin! Come back!”

Willi’s hand anchored her, warmth and love flowing through the bond.

Tobi’s music gave her a thread to follow, guiding her through the storm of memories.

Lin wove a permanent charm into the orchard’s heart, anchoring the guardian spirit and stabilizing the layline. The trees settled, their branches relaxing, and the spirits returned to their homes.

The guardian’s gratitude was quiet—a basket of perfect apples, a promise of future harvests. The fox spirit curled beside Lin, content to watch rather than interfere.

Exhausted but fulfilled, Lin knew the work was not finished. The orchard would need ongoing care, and the party’s reputation as spirit mediators would spread. But for now, the night was gentle, and the orchard whispered its thanks on the wind.
