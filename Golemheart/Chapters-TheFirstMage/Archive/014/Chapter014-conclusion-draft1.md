The massive Rowan tree's presence pressed against Lin's mind like a physical weight, ancient grief so profound it made her chest ache with sympathetic sorrow. The Spirit-lantern's light revealed the full horror of what had been done—dark veins pulsed through bark that should have been silver-smooth, and the air around the trunk hummed with that same painful frequency that had tortured the village's laylines.

"It's still conscious," Lin whispered, stepping closer despite every instinct screaming at her to flee. "I can feel it trying to communicate, but the corruption is like static drowning out a whisper."

The tree's massive trunk shuddered, and a sound emerged that was part groan, part sob—a voice so old and broken it seemed to come from the earth itself. Words formed in Lin's mind, not heard but felt: _Help... me... cannot... stop..._

Willi moved to Lin's side, her herb pouch already open. "What does it need? What kind of healing can reach something this damaged?"

Before Lin could answer, the corruption in the tree pulsed, and the clearing filled with a wave of temporal distortion. For a sickening moment, Lin experienced every second of the past two weeks simultaneously—the tree's slow descent into madness, the gradual poisoning of the laylines, the village trapped in its endless loops. The sensation of living through weeks of agony in seconds left her gasping and dizzy.

"The dungeon break," she realized, pieces clicking together as the vision faded. "When the Academy's wards failed, the magical feedback traveled through the laylines. But this tree was already weakened by something else. The shock of the rupture pushed it over the edge into corruption."

Greta's sword rang as she drew it, not in threat but in readiness. "Can it be healed, or must it be put out of its misery?"

The tree shuddered again at her words, and Lin felt a spike of desperate fear from its consciousness. _Not... death... please... remember... what... was..._

"It remembers being a guardian," Lin said, tears streaming down her face as she shared the tree's memories. "Centuries of protecting this forest, nurturing the spirits, maintaining the balance. It doesn't want to die—it wants to remember how to live properly again."

Tobi approached cautiously, his lute already in his hands. "Music helped calm the spirits before. Maybe it can reach through the corruption too." He began to play a gentle melody, something that reminded Lin of spring rain and new growth.

The effect was immediate. The tree's agonized groaning softened slightly, and some of the violence went out of the pulsing dark veins. But it wasn't enough—the corruption was too deep, too entrenched to be soothed away by music alone.

"I need to try Threadcraft," Lin said, though the thought of attempting such delicate magic near so much corruption made her stomach turn. "But not to force it back to health. I need to help it remember what it chose to be, before the pain made it forget."

She approached the tree's base, where the corruption was thickest, and placed her palm against the twisted bark. The contact sent shockwaves of agony up her arm, but she gritted her teeth and reached deeper with her magical senses, searching for any trace of the tree's original nature.

There—buried beneath layers of pain and twisted magic—she found it. A tiny seed of the tree's true self, still pure, still remembering its purpose as a guardian and protector. But reaching it would mean diving through all that corruption, exposing herself to the same madness that had claimed the tree.

"I can do this," she said, though her voice shook with uncertainty. "But I'll need you to anchor me. Don't let me get lost in its pain."

Willi knelt beside her and pressed a hand to Lin's back, right over her heart. "We won't let you fall," she said simply. "Breathe with me. In... and out..."

Greta positioned herself where she could see the entire clearing, sword ready for any threat. "I'll watch for corruption trying to spread to us. If I say retreat, you listen."

Tobi moved closer, his music weaving through the air like a net of protection. "I'll keep playing," he said. "Follow the melody if you get lost. It'll lead you back to us."

Lin closed her eyes and let her consciousness sink into the tree's tortured mind. The corruption hit her like a physical blow—centuries of accumulated pain, confusion, and rage crashed over her in waves. She felt herself beginning to drown in the tree's madness, losing track of where Lin ended and the ancient guardian began.

But Willi's hand on her back was an anchor, steady and warm. Tobi's music was a lifeline, pulling her forward through the chaos. And somewhere ahead, she could sense that tiny spark of the tree's true nature, waiting to be remembered.

The Threadcraft she wove wasn't meant to heal or repair—it was meant to remind. Each thread she laid down carried a memory of what the tree had been: the guardian who had sheltered lost travelers, who had sung lullabies to frightened spirits, who had helped young trees grow strong and straight. She wove stories of spring mornings and autumn harvests, of children playing in the tree's shade and lovers carving initials in its bark.

The corruption fought back, trying to twist her threads into knots of pain and rage. But Lin held firm to the memories of light, and slowly, gradually, the tree began to remember what it had chosen to be.

The moment of breakthrough came like sunrise after the longest night. The tree's consciousness suddenly blazed with recognition, and the dark veins pulsing through its bark began to fade. The agonized groaning transformed into something closer to a sigh of relief, and the temporal distortions rippling through the clearing stilled.

Lin opened her eyes to find the tree transformed. The bark had returned to its natural silver-gray, and healthy leaves rustled in a breeze that carried the scent of growing things. The Spirit-lantern's light revealed laylines flowing smoothly once again, no longer twisted into knots of agony.

"Thank you," the tree's voice whispered in her mind, clear and strong now. "I remember. I remember what I am."

The restoration spread outward from the tree like ripples in a pond. Corrupted spirits throughout the forest suddenly straightened as the pain left them, their forms becoming solid and healthy once more. The oppressive darkness lifted, replaced by the natural twilight of a forest evening.

In the distance, Lin could hear the sounds of Rowan Hollow returning to normal—voices calling out in confusion and relief as the temporal loops finally broke. People would remember the lost weeks as if waking from a nightmare, but they would be free to move forward into tomorrow.

"Is it over?" Greta asked, lowering her sword as she felt the last of the supernatural tension drain from the air.

Lin leaned back against the tree's trunk, exhausted but smiling. "It's over. The guardian is itself again, and the laylines are flowing properly." She looked up at the tree's canopy, where spirits were beginning to emerge from hiding. "It's going to take time for everything to fully heal, but the corruption is gone."

Willi pressed a water flask into Lin's hands. "Drink," she ordered gently. "You look like you've aged a year in the past hour."

As they prepared to leave the clearing, the guardian's voice whispered once more in Lin's mind: "The village will need watching. The trauma of what happened here has weakened the barriers between worlds. I will stand guard, but strange things may still slip through in the coming months."

Lin nodded, understanding. Their work here was finished, but the consequences would ripple outward for some time to come. That was the nature of magic—every solution created new responsibilities, new connections that would need tending.

They walked back through the forest in comfortable silence, the Spirit-lantern's light no longer needed now that natural moonlight filtered through healthy leaves. Behind them, the guardian settled into its eternal watch, once again the protector it had always been meant to be.
