# Chapter 14: Evernight at Rowan Hollow

The countryside rolled past Lin's horse in waves of amber light that should have been afternoon sunshine but felt wrong against her skin. She shifted in her saddle and pressed her blackthorn staff against her knee, the Forest Spirit within recoiling from whatever tainted the air around them. The wrongness tasted like copper pennies and stale breath, as if the world had been holding its lungs closed for hours.

Lin tilted her head back to study the sun, which hung motionless in a sky the color of old honey. Her shadow stretched in the same direction it had when they'd stopped for lunch, and before that, and before that. Time wasn't just slow here—it was broken.

"Anyone else notice we've been riding toward that same cloud for three hours?" Tobi asked, pointing at a wispy formation that should have drifted away by now. He strummed a few experimental notes on his lute, the melody hanging in the still air longer than it should. "Either my music's gotten incredibly compelling, or we're stuck in the world's most ominous painting."

"Perfect," Lin said with forced lightness. "I've always wanted to be an extra in an ominous tableau."

Greta barked a short laugh without humor. "If you're going to be dramatic, at least look heroic while you do it."

Willi folded her hands around a wrapped loaf. "Heroism is overrated when it's empty stomach heroism," she said practically. "Here, eat." She offered Lin half the loaf—the gesture was matter-of-fact, not sentimental, but Lin felt steadier for it.

Tobi accepted a scrap and grinned. "See? Food fixes everything—except time. Time seems stubbornly carb-free."

Greta's armored boots clinked against her stirrups as she shifted to look around them, her expression growing serious again. "The Light preserve us. This is no natural phenomenon." Her voice carried the weight of someone who'd seen corruption before, but nothing quite like this. "How long since anyone has seen proper dawn or dusk in these lands?"

"Two weeks," Willi said grimly, consulting the Guild posting she'd been studying. "Since the dungeon break. Village has been sending messengers, but most never made it out. The few that did..." She shook her head. "They spoke of people trapped in endless repetition."

As they crested the final hill, Rowan Hollow spread below them like a music box with a broken spring. Lin counted the baker's movements as he carried the same tray past the same window—once, twice, three times in perfect intervals. The same loaf of bread, the same careful step around the same loose cobblestone, the same wave to the same woman hanging the same three shirts on the same section of line.

"Fresh bread! Finest in the valley!" the baker called, his voice carrying across the unnatural stillness. Exactly three minutes and forty-seven seconds later, he repeated the call with identical inflection.

Lin's stomach clenched as she watched the woman hanging laundry. Each time, she pinned the blue shirt first, then the white one, then the child's tunic. But with every repetition, her movements grew slightly more mechanical, her eyes a little more vacant. How long before these people forgot who they were entirely?

"We need to map this carefully before we do anything else," Willi said, dismounting and pulling out her notebook. "See how far the temporal boundaries extend, what patterns we're dealing with."

Lin slid down from her horse and immediately extended her awareness toward the laylines that should flow beneath the village like underground rivers. The moment her consciousness touched them, agony exploded through her skull like lightning striking bone. She cried out and stumbled, clutching her staff as waves of wrongness crashed over her magical senses.

The laylines weren't flowing—they writhed like wounded animals, twisted into impossible knots that pulsed with sick red light. Each pulse sent needles of pain straight through her temples and down her spine. She tried to trace the source of the torture, but the magical currents flinched away from her touch like things in too much agony to bear contact.

"They're not just damaged," she gasped, pressing her free hand to her forehead where a vicious headache was building. "Something's feeding on them, twisting them deliberately. The laylines are screaming."

They spent the next hour walking the village perimeter, Lin fighting nausea with each step closer to the temporal distortions. The loops weren't uniform—some villagers repeated three-minute cycles, others stretched to twelve minutes or more. A blacksmith raised and lowered his hammer in perfect rhythm, the same three strikes on the same horseshoe that would never be finished. Two children played an eternal game of catch, their laughter echoing the same notes at the same intervals until the sound became a mockery of joy.

When Willi approached an elderly woman sweeping her doorstep, Lin watched the interaction with growing dread. The woman looked up with eyes that seemed to see through them to something far away and long past.

"Harvest day, dear," the woman said, her voice hollow as an echo in an empty well. "Always harvest day in Rowan Hollow. Been blessed with such fine weather, praise the Light." She returned to sweeping, each stroke covering the exact same three-foot patch of stone she'd been scrubbing clean for two weeks.

"How long has it been harvest day?" Willi asked gently.

"Why, today of course!" The woman's response came too quickly, too cheerfully, like a music box ballerina wound too tight. "Such a lovely harvest day. Been blessed with such fine weather, praise the Light." The words began repeating even as she spoke them, layering over themselves until they became meaningless noise.

A low humming drifted across the village, barely audible but persistent. Lin felt it in her teeth, in the hollow spaces between her ribs. The sound matched the rhythm of the corrupted laylines' convulsions, and when she turned toward the ancient forest that bordered the village's northern edge, the humming grew stronger.

"There," she said, pointing toward the treeline where the air seemed to shimmer with heat that had nothing to do with temperature. "Whatever's doing this is in those woods."

The walk to the forest felt longer than it should have, each step taking them further from the broken normalcy of the village and closer to something that made Lin's skin crawl with anticipation. The forest entrance loomed before them like a mouth full of broken teeth, and as they approached, Lin saw they weren't alone.

Dozens of spirits clustered around the treeline, but these weren't the peaceful woodland sprites she'd expected. Their small bodies pressed together in desperate huddles, chittering warnings in voices like glass breaking against stone.

"Turn back! Turn back!" A tuckling burst from behind a tree trunk, its bark-skin mottled with stress patterns that looked like infected wounds. "Great hunger wakes! Old promises break! No passage for warm-bloods!"

More spirits emerged from hiding—rootlings that should have been tending forest growth instead twisted their branches into barrier patterns, while shadow-wisps darted between the trees like living warning flags. They weren't attacking, Lin realized. They were terrified, trying to protect them from something that had traumatized every living thing in the forest.

"What's got you all so scared?" she asked softly, kneeling among the panicked spirits. She could feel their terror like a physical weight, pressing against her chest until breathing became difficult.

The brave tuckling approached her outstretched hand with obvious reluctance. When its tiny branch touched her finger, images flooded her mind—flashes of something ancient and beloved writhing in pain, of laylines twisted into knots of agony, of a presence that had once been protector becoming predator.

"Oh," Lin breathed, tears stinging her eyes as she understood. "You're trying to protect us from something you love. Something that's been corrupted beyond recognition."

Willi knelt beside her and began humming a gentle lullaby, the melody floating through the air like warm honey. Several spirits stopped their frantic chittering to listen, their panic easing slightly at the comforting sound.

Greta stepped forward with solemn dignity. "By the Light that guides all souls to righteousness," she said formally, placing her hand over her heart, "we swear we come not as conquerors but as healers. Honor demands we attempt to mend what has been broken, to ease the suffering that drives good spirits to such desperation."

Tobi sat on a fallen log and pulled out his lute, his usual mischievous grin replaced by quiet focus. "Hey, little ones," he said gently, beginning to play a soft melody that complemented Willi's humming. "We've seen broken things before. Sometimes they can be fixed, if someone cares enough to try. Will you let us try?"

The spirits wavered between terror and desperate hope. Finally, the tuckling spoke for all of them: "Warm-bloods may pass. But beware—great tree grieves beyond healing. Ancient hunger grows beyond stopping. Old friend becomes old enemy, and we cannot save what will not be saved."

The wall of spirits parted reluctantly, creating a narrow path between the trees. The moment they stepped across the threshold, Lin felt something fundamental shift in the air around them. The temperature dropped until her breath came out in visible puffs, and shadows moved independently of any light source, reaching toward them with finger-like tendrils.

"This darkness isn't natural," Greta muttered, her sword hand twitching toward her hilt. Her voice carried an edge Lin had rarely heard before—not fear exactly, but deep unease. "It presses against the soul like a physical weight."

Lin pulled out a torch and struck flint, but the flame guttered weakly in the supernatural gloom. "Normal light won't work here," she realized, watching their pitiful circle of illumination shrink to barely an arm's length. "The corruption is too thick. I can't read the laylines properly through all this interference."

An idea sparked in her memory—half-remembered lessons from her grandmother about tools that could see through spiritual darkness. "I need to make something new. A Spirit-lantern that can pierce through corruption like this."

Lin settled cross-legged on the forest floor, her friends forming a protective circle around her. She pulled out silk thread that shimmered with its own faint luminescence, a small crystal from Tobi's collection that caught even the dim light, and her grandmother's etching stylus with its worn bone handle.

The work demanded absolute precision. Each spirit-thread had to be woven through specific points on the crystal's surface, creating pathways for spiritual energy to flow without the layline corruption interfering. Lin's fingers cramped from the delicate movements, and sweat beaded on her forehead despite the unnatural chill.

"Little spirits," she whispered as she worked, keeping her voice gentle and inviting. "I need a partner—someone brave enough to help guide us through this darkness. Someone who wants to heal the pain poisoning your home."

A tiny spark of light drifted down from the branches above, no larger than her thumb and pulsing with nervous energy. Lin held perfectly still as it circled the crystal, investigating her work with the careful attention of a master craftsman examining another's technique.

"Hello there," she said softly. "We're partners in this, not master and servant. You can leave anytime if you don't like what we're doing. We're just asking for your help to see clearly in places where normal sight fails."

The spirit settled onto the crystal with a sound like wind chimes made of silver and starlight. Lin could feel its curiosity mixing with deep worry about whatever waited in the forest's heart, but also a tentative hope that maybe, just maybe, these strange warm-bloods might actually be able to help.

When the weaving was complete, Lin cupped the finished lantern in both hands and took a steadying breath. "This is going to hurt," she warned her friends. "Hearthflame is part of my life force. Giving it away means giving away part of myself."

She opened her inner flame with careful deliberation, feeling the warm golden energy that lived at her core—the part of her that was most essentially Lin Xiu, that made her more than just flesh and bone. Then, with an act of will that felt like tearing off a piece of her own soul, she breathed a stream of pure Hearthflame into the crystal.

The world immediately became colder and more distant. Colors drained from her vision as exhaustion hit like a physical blow, leaving her swaying and hollow. If Willi hadn't caught her shoulders, she would have collapsed face-first into the forest loam.

But the Spirit-lantern blazed to life with soft, steady radiance that seemed to warm the air for several feet around them. The little spirit inside chimed contentedly, its fear transforming into determination now that it had purpose and protection.

"Thank you," Lin whispered to her ethereal partner, hanging the lantern from her staff with hands that shook like autumn leaves. "Now let's see what we're really dealing with."

The lantern's light revealed a landscape transformed by corruption. Laylines became visible as ribbons of sickly red energy, all flowing toward the forest's heart like blood drawn toward an open wound. Small spirits clustered around the trees—not healthy woodland sprites, but creatures driven half-mad by pain they couldn't escape. Most disturbing of all, Lin could see the corruption itself: veins of oily darkness running through everything, pulsing with a malevolent hunger that made her stomach turn.

"Something's feeding," she said, her voice barely above a whisper. "Not just consuming the laylines for power, but actively torturing them. Making them hurt on purpose."

As they prepared to venture deeper into the forest, the Spirit-lantern attracted attention from local spirits who emerged from hiding with desperate hope written across their small faces. Tucklings with expressions of too-human pain gathered around Willi when she offered them crumbs of travel bread. Shadow-wisps flickered between visibility, too damaged to maintain solid form but drawn to the healing light like moths to flame.

"The path winds true but danger grows," the spirit in the lantern chimed, its voice like silver bells touched with ancient sorrow. "Ancient friend sleeps in pain, dreams in hunger. We guide where feet may walk, but hearts must be strong for what waits ahead."

The path wound deeper into the haunted woods, shifting constantly as passages that had been clear moments before would suddenly branch in different directions. Lin had to trust the little spirit's guidance to avoid walking in circles, while behind her she could hear Greta's breathing grow shorter and more controlled as the supernatural darkness pressed in from all sides.

Finally, after what felt like hours of careful navigation through the maze of corrupted trees, they emerged into a clearing where a single massive Rowan tree stood at the center. Its trunk easily measured sixty feet around, and its canopy disappeared into the supernatural gloom above. But this wasn't the majestic guardian it should have been.

Dark veins pulsed through its bark like infected arteries, and the air around it hummed with the same painful frequency that had echoed through the village. The tree's presence filled the clearing with an aura of ancient grief so profound that Lin felt tears spring to her eyes without knowing why.

"There," she breathed, feeling the Spirit-lantern's light waver as they approached the source of all this torment. "That's what's been feeding on the laylines. But once upon a time, this was something beautiful, wasn't it?"

The massive Rowan tree loomed before them, its corrupted form radiating centuries of pain and twisted hunger, waiting for them to draw close enough to understand what tragedy had transformed a forest guardian into an engine of temporal torment.
