# Chapter 22 Critique - Sea-Witch Wards

## Overall Assessment: 7/10

### Strengths:
- Excellent maritime atmosphere and cultural detail
- Strong characterization of Henrik as traditional practitioner
- Good explanation of how blessing ceremonies became empty ritual
- Effective setup for large-scale ward magic experimentation

### Major Issues:

#### 1. Church Suppression Barely Addressed
- Sea-witch wards obviously contradict Church doctrine about protective magic sources
- No discussion of how Church eliminated maritime magical traditions
- Henrik's loss of ward power treated as natural decline rather than systematic suppression
- Greta shows no awareness that ship protection magic violates Church monopoly

#### 2. Greta's Crisis Opportunity Missed
- Witnesses traditional protection magic that clearly serves Light's purpose of preserving life
- Should recognize that effective ship wards serve divine will better than Church-approved methods
- No internal conflict about whether sea-witch traditions oppose or fulfill her protective duties
- Missing chance to show growing tension between Church doctrine and witnessed effective magic

#### 3. Weak Arc 05 Corruption Setup
- Ward failure described as gradual decline rather than active corruption
- Should show evidence that layline instability is specifically damaging maritime protection
- No connection between failing ward systems and spreading magical corruption
- Missing sense that traditional revival might address current crisis patterns

#### 4. Political Context Underdeveloped  
- Learning sea-witch techniques makes them heretics by Church definition
- No awareness that ward revival could trigger Church investigation
- Henrik shares forbidden knowledge without adequate persecution warnings
- Missing discussion of how Church persecutes maritime traditional practitioners

#### 5. Theological Implications Ignored
- Ship protection clearly serves divine purpose of preserving lives at sea
- No exploration of whether sea-witch traditions better serve Light than Church alternatives
- Group doesn't recognize theological significance of effective life-preservation magic
- Missing connection between traditional protection and divine protection concepts

### Specific Scene Issues:
- Ward experimentation proceeds without considering Church detection risks
- Henrik's traditional knowledge shared without discussing persecution dangers
- No mention of how Church authorities handle maritime magic revival
- Missing sense that successful ward creation brands them as heretical practitioners

### Missing Elements for Arc Setup:
- Evidence that Church specifically targeted maritime magical traditions
- Signs that layline corruption is causing traditional protection failures
- Greta's recognition that effective life-preservation serves Light's will
- Connection between ward techniques and solutions to spreading magical instability
- Awareness that sea-witch magic makes them prime targets for Church persecution

### Character Development Gaps:
- Greta witnesses effective protective magic without questioning Church doctrine
- Lin doesn't recognize danger of practicing exactly what Church considers most threatening
- Henrik doesn't warn about ongoing persecution risks for traditional practitioners
- Group treats ward magic as technical challenge rather than theological statement

## Revision Priorities:
1. Add Greta's profound realization that ship protection serves Light's will better than Church doctrine
2. Include evidence of Church systematic destruction of maritime magical traditions
3. Show ward failure as early indicator of spreading layline corruption affecting coastal regions
4. Establish that sea-witch magic revival makes them heretical by Church standards
5. Connect traditional protection techniques to solutions for current magical crisis
6. Build tension about Church detection of large-scale ward creation
