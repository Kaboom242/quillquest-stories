# Chapter 15: The Haunted Bridge - Completion Draft 1

Lin breathed deeply as her horse crested the final hill before the Silberbach valley, savoring air that tasted properly of summer grass instead of the metallic corruption they'd left behind at Rowan Hollow. Her muscles finally unknotted from the tension of working so close to layline torture, and she let herself appreciate the clean morning light that turned the surrounding farmland into gold and emerald patches.

The reprieve lasted exactly until she extended her magical senses toward their destination and felt the tangle waiting ahead—not the screaming agony of corrupted magic, but something that pulled at her chest with the weight of old grief and unfinished business.

"Bridge has been impassable for five days," Willi said, unfolding their contract against her saddle horn with the methodical attention she brought to all their jobs. "Merchants report seeing figures that vanish when approached, and water that speaks in voices of the drowned." Her frown suggested she found the latter claim particularly dubious. "Local garrison tried to clear it twice, but their horses refuse to set hoof on the stones."

Tobi strummed a melody that bounced cheerfully off the hills around them. "Horses have more sense than most soldiers. They can smell death magic from a mile away, unlike humans who require actual corpses before asking uncomfortable questions."

As they descended toward the river, Lin watched the bridge resolve from distant smudge to detailed architecture. Five graceful stone arches should have carried travelers safely across the Silberbach's summer flow. Instead, frost glittered along railings that should have been warm with afternoon sun, and mist rose from dark water in spirals that defied every natural law Lin knew.

Pale figures moved back and forth across the span like moths trapped against glass, their movements visible even from half a mile away. Something about their desperate repetition made Lin's throat tighten with sympathetic anguish. These weren't the chaotic flailings of corrupted spirits—they moved with purpose, as if eternally searching for something just beyond their reach.

"The Light has shown me visions of restless spirits in my prayers," Greta said, her armor creaking as she studied the haunted span ahead. "Souls trapped between this world and the next, unable to find peace." Her voice carried the weight of experience with such hauntings. "They often manifest near water, which holds memories longer than stone or earth."

The south approach to the bridge had become an impromptu camp where frustrated travelers waited for passage that might never come. Lin dismounted near a weathered merchant whose wagon sat heavy with goods bound for northern markets, his face carrying the exhausted frustration of someone forced to watch the same impossible sight for too many days.

"Started right after the big storm passed through," he told her when she asked about the haunting. His voice held the hollow quality of someone who'd told this story too many times. "Water rose faster than anyone's seen in living memory—came down from the mountains like a wall. When it finally went down again, they were there." His pointing finger trembled slightly as he indicated the ghostly figures. "Keep reaching for something in the water, searching and searching, but they can't quite touch whatever it is."

Lin left her horse with the others and approached the bridge itself, immediately feeling the wrongness that had spooked every animal for miles. The temperature dropped with each step toward the stone approach, the chill biting through her summer clothes like winter wind sharp enough to cut skin. Her breath began coming out in white puffs despite the afternoon sun warming her shoulders, and frost crunched under her boots where it had no business existing.

The laylines beneath the ancient stones felt tangled but not corrupted when she extended her magical senses toward them—twisted into knots that spoke of sudden violence and desperate urgency rather than the deliberate torture she'd experienced at Rowan Hollow. When she pressed deeper with her consciousness, images flashed through her mind: dark water rushing higher than should have been possible, desperate voices calling over the thunder of flash flood, reaching hands that couldn't quite span the distance to something precious being swept away by the merciless current.

"There was a tragedy here," she said, the certainty settling cold and heavy in her chest. "Something sudden that left them unable to move on. But they're not feeding on the laylines like the corrupted tree was—they're just stuck, trapped by something they couldn't finish."

Tobi's lute sang a soft, questioning melody into the unnatural chill, and Lin watched one of the ghostly figures pause in its endless pacing to turn toward the sound. For one heartbreaking moment, features resolved from pale mist—a young woman's face marked with desperate longing and unbearable sadness, hope and terror warring in eyes that seemed to look directly at Lin before dissolving back into translucent fog.

"Music draws them," Lin realized, her voice barely above a whisper as understanding began to crystallize. "They're still connected to the living world somehow. That's why they can't pass on—something's anchoring them here, something they need to finish."

As afternoon wore toward evening and shadows lengthened across the valley, the spirits became more solid, their movements more frantic. Lin could now make out details she'd missed from a distance—travel cloaks that rippled in no earthly wind, sturdy boots that left no prints on frost-covered stone, the practical garments of people caught by disaster while journeying far from home.

A ghostly man in a leather coat paced the bridge's center, repeatedly examining something cupped in his translucent hands while his face twisted with anguish that made Lin's chest ache. Near the northern end, two women held what might have been a length of rope, their mouths moving in conversation no living ear could hear.

The breakthrough came as true dusk approached and the temperature around the bridge plummeted until thick ice began forming on the stone railings. Lin pressed close enough to the haunted span that her skin stung with supernatural cold, straining to catch fragments of voices that drifted like whispers carried on wind that touched nothing but her ears:

"—find the rope, someone find the rope—"
"—too deep, water's too deep, can't reach—"
"—baby's crying, dear Light, where's the baby—"

The words hit Lin like a physical blow, stealing her breath and sending ice through her veins that had nothing to do with the unnatural chill. Understanding crashed over her with horrible clarity, each piece of the puzzle falling into place with the weight of a gravestone.

"They're not the ones who died," she whispered, horror and pity warring in her chest as she stared at the desperate spirits. "They're the ones who lived through it. They're trying to save someone who's still down there."

She pointed with a shaking hand toward the water beneath the bridge's central arch, where current ran deepest and swiftest around obstacles she couldn't see. "There's someone in the river. Someone they couldn't save when the flood hit, and now they're trapped here trying to finish the rescue. They've been searching for five days straight, reaching for someone who's beyond any mortal help."

The implications made her stomach turn with nausea that had nothing to do with magical corruption. Seven people had survived whatever catastrophe struck this bridge, but their inability to save one person—one baby, if the ghostly voices spoke true—had bound them here more completely than any curse.

Greta strode toward the bridge with purpose that made her armor ring like funeral bells. "Then we finish what they started," she declared, her voice carrying the absolute conviction that had always marked her dedication to protecting the innocent. "No soul should be lost when help is possible, whether they draw breath or not."

But as Lin took her first step onto the frost-slicked stones of the bridge approach, the ghostly figures turned toward her with expressions that made her heart clench with sympathetic pain. Seven souls reached out with translucent hands, their desperate need pressing against her consciousness like a physical weight. Wild hope blazed in their spectral faces, but underneath it lurked terrible fear—the terror of people who had failed once and couldn't bear to fail again.

The cold bit deeper as Lin walked onto the span itself, each step sending shivers through her bones that had nothing to do with temperature. The spirits drew closer, their forms becoming more solid as her living warmth touched the ancient stones. She could see them clearly now—a merchant family caught by the flood while traveling, their faces etched with five days of endless searching for something they could never quite reach.

Lin knelt at the bridge's center and pressed her palms against the stone, extending her consciousness down through the laylines toward the dark water below. The magical current was twisted into knots of grief and desperation, but underneath that tangle she felt something else—a tiny spark of warmth that didn't belong to the flowing river.

"There," she breathed, tears freezing on her cheeks as she understood. "There's a baby down there. Still alive somehow, protected by something, but trapped where no living hands can reach."

The ghostly man with the leather coat knelt beside her, his translucent form flickering with desperate hope. When he spoke, his voice came through the laylines rather than the air, speaking directly to her magical senses with words that carried five days of anguish: "Little Anna. Our daughter. The water took her, but we can't leave. Can't stop trying. Please—you have to save her."

Lin closed her eyes and sent her consciousness deeper, following the twisted laylines down through cold water toward the source of that warm spark. What she found defied all natural law—a pocket of air trapped beneath a fallen log, held in place by the desperate love of seven spirits who had refused to let their child drown. Their combined will had created a bubble of safety that had kept the baby alive for five impossible days, but Lin could feel the protection weakening as their spiritual energy slowly faded.

"She's alive," Lin said, her voice cracking with emotion as she opened her eyes to find all seven spirits gathered around her. "You saved her. Your love has been keeping her alive, but I need to get her out before the protection fails."

Lin transformed her blackthorn staff into a length of rope strong enough to bear weight, the Forest Spirit within eagerly cooperating as it sensed the life-or-death urgency of the situation. The rope glowed with soft silver light as she lowered it into the water, using her magical senses to guide it toward the trapped child.

The current fought her every inch of the way, trying to sweep the rope downstream toward the deeper channels where recovery would be impossible. But Lin held firm, pouring her own life force into the Threadcraft magic that guided the rope through the dark water. Willi stood at her shoulder, adding her own magical strength to maintain the line's integrity against the battering current.

When the rope finally reached the air pocket, Lin felt a tiny hand grasp it with the desperate strength that only terror could provide. The baby's cries echoed up through the water, muffled but heartbreakingly alive. Lin began to pull, fighting against the current and the weight of waterlogged clothing, while the spirits pressed close around her with expressions of wild hope and unbearable tension.

The rescue felt like it took hours, though it could only have been minutes. Lin's arms burned with effort as she hauled against the river's strength, while ice formed on her hands from the supernatural cold radiating from the bridge. But finally—finally—a small bundle broke the surface of the water, and Lin pulled a baby girl onto the frost-covered stones of the bridge.

Little Anna couldn't have been more than six months old, her face blue with cold but her lungs working strongly as she wailed her terror into the night air. Lin immediately wrapped her in her own cloak, sharing her Hearthflame warmth to drive the deadly chill from tiny limbs while Willi began checking for injuries with the practical efficiency that made her invaluable in crisis situations.

The moment the baby was safe on the bridge, the change in the spirits was immediate and profound. The desperate fear that had twisted their features for five days melted away, replaced by profound relief and overwhelming gratitude. The ghostly man who was Anna's father knelt beside Lin with tears streaming down his translucent face.

"Thank you," he whispered, his voice carrying through the laylines with emotion too deep for words. "We can rest now. We can finally rest."

One by one, the spirits began to fade as the bonds holding them to the mortal world dissolved. They had finished what they started—their daughter was safe, their duty complete. The bridge warmed as their supernatural presence departed, frost melting from the railings as natural temperature returned to the ancient stones.

The baby's cries had attracted attention from the stranded travelers, and soon Lin found herself surrounded by grateful merchants and farmers who had been trapped on the wrong side of the river for days. A woman with children of her own took charge of little Anna's immediate care, while others began organizing a proper search for any surviving family members.

As the bridge returned to normal and traffic began flowing across the span once more, Lin stood at the railing and looked down at the Silberbach's dark water. The laylines beneath the stones ran clean and straight now, carrying no trace of the anguish that had knotted them for five days. The spirits had found their peace, their love finally rewarded with the rescue they had died trying to achieve.

"Seven people gave their lives trying to save one child," Greta said quietly, joining Lin at the railing. "And in the end, their sacrifice was not in vain."

Lin nodded, watching the water flow toward distant seas that would carry word of this night to shores where other spirits might learn that love could triumph over death, that some bonds were stronger than the grave. The haunted bridge of Silberbach would trouble travelers no more, but the story of the family who wouldn't abandon their daughter would echo through the laylines for generations to come.
