# Chapter 17: Northern Runes - Draft 1

The morning light streaming through the Academy dormitory windows felt like a blessing after weeks of dealing with corrupted laylines and supernatural emergencies. Lin stretched in her narrow bed, savoring the simple pleasure of waking up somewhere safe and warm, with no immediate magical crisis demanding her attention.

She padded barefoot to the window and looked out over Eisenstadt's bustling streets. The city had transformed completely since the dungeon's emergence. Where once she'd seen familiar shops and quiet residential areas, now merchant stalls crowded every available space, their colorful awnings fluttering in the morning breeze. Adventuring parties clustered around the Guild's temporary processing station, their weapons and armor catching the sunlight as they discussed contracts and dungeon tactics.

The sight made her smile. After so much destruction and chaos, it felt good to see the city thriving again, even if the crowds sometimes made simple errands take twice as long as they should.

Lin dressed quickly and made her way to the Academy's expanded kitchens, where she'd been experimenting with potioncraft for the past two weeks. The space had grown considerably since the Library Spirit's renovations, with multiple brewing stations, enhanced ventilation that actually worked, and storage alcoves that somehow stayed at perfect temperature without any visible magical apparatus.

She found Willi already there, expertly tending three different breakfast preparations while keeping one eye on a simmering pot that smelled suspiciously like Lin's latest healing draught experiment.

"Morning," Willi said without looking up from the eggs she was scrambling. "Your stamina potion is ready for testing, but I'm making breakfast first. Nobody experiments on magical brews before eating properly."

Lin accepted a plate of perfectly prepared eggs and fresh bread, noting how Willi had somehow managed to make even simple food taste exceptional. It was one of those practical talents that seemed effortless but probably took years to develop properly.

"Any volunteers for testing today?" Lin asked between bites.

Willi's expression suggested she found the question amusing. "Tobi's been dropping hints about wanting to try the energy restoration brew, but I think he's more interested in impressing you with his willingness to risk magical side effects than actually needing stamina enhancement."

As if summoned by their conversation, Tobi appeared in the kitchen doorway with his usual theatrical flourish. His hair looked like he'd made some effort to tame it this morning, though several stubborn strands still insisted on defying gravity in ways that somehow managed to be charming rather than messy.

"Did someone mention my legendary willingness to risk life and limb for the advancement of magical knowledge?" he asked, sliding into a chair with practiced grace. "Or were you discussing my other legendary qualities? Because I have so many, it's hard to keep track."

Lin rolled her eyes while Willi placed a plate in front of him with the kind of precision that suggested long practice dealing with his dramatics. "We were discussing whether you're brave enough to test my latest potion, or just trying to show off."

"Can't it be both?" Tobi grinned, accepting the food with genuine appreciation. "Though I should point out that volunteering to test experimental magical brews is legitimately dangerous. I'm basically risking my devastatingly handsome face for science."

Greta's arrival was announced by the distinctive sound of her armor in the corridor outside. She entered the kitchen already fully equipped for the day, her blonde hair neatly braided and her surcoat bearing the Luminant Church's symbol freshly polished.

"Good morning," she said, accepting the breakfast Willi offered with a grateful nod. "I've been speaking with the Guild representatives about our recent contracts. They're very pleased with our work on the layline repairs, and several other cities have requested similar assistance."

Lin felt a warm glow of satisfaction. After weeks of feeling like she was improvising her way through magical problems too complex for her limited training, it was reassuring to know their efforts had produced genuinely helpful results.

"Any specific requests?" she asked.

"Three towns report layline disturbances, two have spirit manifestations that need investigation, and there's something about a haunted mill that the local garrison can't handle." Greta consulted a small notebook she'd produced from somewhere in her armor. "All well within our capabilities, and the pay is quite good."

Tobi swallowed a bite of bread and raised his hand. "I vote for the haunted mill. Mills always have the best stories, and if we're lucky, there might be a mysterious miller's daughter who needs rescuing from supernatural forces."

"The mill request specifically mentions that the miller's family fled three weeks ago," Greta said dryly. "So your romantic fantasies will have to find other outlets."

Willi collected their empty plates with efficient movements. "Before we take any new contracts, Lin needs to finish testing her potions. The Guild's been asking about purchasing healing draughts for their standard supply packages, which could provide steady income even when we're between adventures."

Lin felt her excitement building. The idea of her experimental potioncraft becoming useful enough for the Guild to stock regularly was both thrilling and terrifying. If her brews worked consistently, they could help injured adventurers across the region. If they failed spectacularly, she'd probably become known as the witch who poisoned half the Guild membership.

"Right," she said, pushing aside her worries. "Tobi, you're sure you want to test the stamina restoration brew? The worst case scenario involves temporary paralysis, uncontrollable singing, or turning temporarily blue."

Tobi's grin widened. "Temporary paralysis sounds restful, uncontrollable singing would give me an excuse to serenade you lovely ladies, and blue is a good color on me. I'm willing to risk it."

They moved to Lin's designated brewing area, where her latest creation waited in a crystal vial that caught the morning light like liquid starlight. The potion had taken three days to prepare properly, involving precise timing with lunar phases, careful temperature control, and ingredients that had to be harvested at specific times.

Lin transformed her staff into a precise measuring device, the blackthorn wood reshaping itself into calibrated markings that would ensure Tobi received exactly the right dose. The Forest Spirit within seemed amused by her careful preparations, its presence a warm certainty that made her confidence grow.

"Just a small sip," she instructed. "We can always give you more if the initial dose doesn't produce noticeable effects."

Tobi lifted the vial with mock ceremony. "To advancement of magical knowledge, and to the three most beautiful and talented women in Eisenstadt." He took a careful sip, then paused as the liquid's effects began to manifest.

His eyes widened slightly, and a faint silver glow began emanating from his skin. When he moved, his motions seemed faster and more precise than usual, as if his reflexes had been enhanced beyond normal human limits.

"That's incredible," he said, his voice carrying a note of genuine wonder beneath the usual playful tone. "I feel like I could run to the next city and back without getting winded. How long will this last?"

Lin consulted her brewing notes. "Probably two to three hours, depending on your natural magical resistance. The glow should fade gradually as the effects wear off."

Willi examined Tobi with the critical eye she usually reserved for cooking ingredients. "Any side effects? Nausea, dizziness, sudden urges to compose terrible poetry?"

"I always have sudden urges to compose terrible poetry," Tobi replied. "But no, I feel fantastic. Lin, this is genuinely impressive work. The Guild will definitely want to purchase these."

Before Lin could respond to the compliment, shouting erupted from the Academy's main courtyard. The voices carried a note of genuine alarm that immediately put all four of them on alert.

They rushed to the nearest window that overlooked the courtyard, where a crowd had gathered around what appeared to be a traveling party that had just arrived in the city. Lin could see horses, loaded packs, and several people gesturing animatedly, but the exact nature of the disturbance wasn't clear from their vantage point.

"Probably another group wanting access to the dungeon," Greta said, though her tone suggested she wasn't entirely convinced. "The registration process has been causing arguments all week."

The shouting intensified, and Lin caught fragments of words that made her skin prickle with recognition: "glowing," "singing," and "won't stop."

"That doesn't sound like a registration dispute," she said, already moving toward the door. "Something magical is happening."

They made their way quickly through the Academy's corridors and out into the courtyard, where the scene that greeted them made Lin's magical senses immediately alert. A travel-stained party of five northerners stood near the Academy's main entrance, their horses stamping nervously while Guild representatives tried to maintain order among a growing crowd of onlookers.

But Lin's attention fixed immediately on the source of the disturbance: one of the travelers carried a leather satchel that pulsed with irregular silver light, and the air around it hummed with a musical tone that seemed to resonate directly with the damaged laylines running beneath the Academy.

The bearer of the satchel was a weathered woman with intricate braids and clothing that spoke of northern clan traditions. Her face showed the kind of calm competence that came from years of dealing with difficult situations, but Lin could see tension in the way she held herself, as if she was struggling to maintain control over whatever was contained in that glowing bag.

"It started singing three miles outside the city," the woman was saying to a Guild representative who looked increasingly out of his depth. "Never done anything like this before. The runes have been quiet for generations, but the moment we got close to your Academy, they began resonating."

Lin felt her pulse quicken. Runes. The woman had said runes, which meant this wasn't just random magical interference. This was something connected to traditions that predated the Academy, the Guild, and possibly even the Church.

She stepped forward, her friends following close behind. "Excuse me," she said, directing her words to the clan woman. "I'm Lin Xiu. I've been working with layline disturbances in this area. Would you mind if I examined what you're carrying? I might be able to help."

The woman's eyes assessed Lin with the kind of rapid evaluation that spoke of long experience judging people's competence and trustworthiness. Whatever she saw seemed to satisfy her, because she nodded slowly.

"Astrid Ironweaver," she said by way of introduction. "These are clan artifacts we're bringing to trade at the border markets. Ceremonial pieces, mostly. Religious significance but no practical use, or so we thought." Her expression suggested recent events had challenged that assumption considerably.

Lin extended her magical senses toward the glowing satchel, immediately feeling the chaotic resonance between whatever was inside and the still-fragile laylines beneath the Academy. The sensation was unlike anything she'd encountered before—not the screaming corruption of damaged magic, but something that felt almost like music played on an instrument that was slightly out of tune.

"The laylines here have been damaged recently," she explained. "It's possible that whatever you're carrying is responding to the instability. May I see the artifacts?"

Astrid glanced at her traveling companions, who offered various nods and shrugs of agreement. "If you think you can help. But be careful—some of these pieces have been in my clan for centuries. They're not just valuable, they're irreplaceable."

She opened the satchel with careful movements, revealing a collection of items that made Lin's breath catch. Carved bone pieces covered with intricate symbols, polished stones with patterns that seemed to shift in the light, and most prominently, a staff made from what looked like antler, with spiraling grooves that had been filled with some kind of dark metal.

The antler staff was the source of the singing. As Lin watched, silver light pulsed along its carved channels in rhythm with the musical tone that filled the air around them. The pattern reminded her of a heartbeat, or perhaps breathing, as if the artifact was somehow alive and responding to their presence.

"These symbols," Lin said, studying the carvings with growing excitement. "They're not decorative, are they? They're functional. They're meant to channel and direct magical energy."

Astrid's expression shifted to something that might have been surprise. "You can read the old marks? Most southerners see them as nothing more than pretty patterns carved by primitive craftsmen."

Before Lin could respond, the antler staff's singing suddenly intensified, its silver glow flaring so brightly that several onlookers stepped back with startled exclamations. The musical tone shifted higher, becoming almost urgent, and Lin felt something deep in her magical awareness respond with recognition.

The Forest Spirit in her blackthorn staff stirred with sudden alertness, its consciousness touching hers with images of ancient trees, standing stones, and magic that predated all the civilized traditions she'd been taught. For one dizzying moment, she felt connected to something vast and old, a tradition of power that had been flowing through the world long before anyone thought to build academies or organize guilds.

"It's trying to communicate," she said, her voice barely above a whisper as understanding dawned. "These aren't just ceremonial objects. They're tools. They're meant to work with the natural flow of magic, not against it."

The implications hit her like a physical blow. Everything she'd learned about magic at the Academy was based on controlling and directing magical energy through careful formulas and precise techniques. But what if there was another way? What if instead of imposing structure on magic, you could work with its natural patterns?

Astrid was watching her with growing interest. "You have the sight," she said, and it wasn't a question. "I wondered if any of the southern mages would be able to see what they truly are. My grandmother always said the old knowledge would return when the world needed it most."

The crowd around them had grown larger, and Lin could see Guild representatives pushing through the press of people, their expressions suggesting they were rapidly losing patience with the situation. If she was going to learn more about these artifacts and what they represented, she needed to act quickly before bureaucracy took control of the situation.

"Would you be willing to show me how they work?" she asked. "I've been experimenting with magical techniques that might complement your traditions. Perhaps we could learn from each other."

Astrid's weathered face broke into the first genuine smile Lin had seen from her. "Now that," she said, "is exactly what my grandmother would have wanted to hear."
