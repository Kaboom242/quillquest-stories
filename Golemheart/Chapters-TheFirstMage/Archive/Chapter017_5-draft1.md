# Chapter 17.5: Preparing for the Journey - Draft 1

The negotiations with Astrid took place in the Academy's expanded workshop, where the scent of brewing potions mixed with the ozone smell of contained magical energy. Lin watched the northern woman examine their facilities with obvious approval, her weathered hands tracing the runic protections built into the workbenches.

"Impressive," Astrid said, noting the careful balance between Academy precision and practical functionality. "Your Library Spirit has good instincts for creating safe experimentation space."

"Safe being a relative term," Tobi commented, pointing to the scorch marks on one wall. "Lin's innovations tend to be... enthusiastic."

"Innovation requires risk," Astrid replied with evident approval. "The old ways were built by people willing to experiment beyond conventional boundaries."

Over the following days, they established a routine that felt both productive and increasingly urgent. Each morning brought new reports of magical instabilities throughout the northern border regions, while Astrid's artifacts continued their irregular singing that made sleep difficult for anyone with magical sensitivity.

"The resonance is getting stronger," Lin observed during their third day of working together. She could feel the antler staff's energy pulsing in harmony with the damaged laylines beneath the Academy, creating feedback loops that worried her on multiple levels.

"Because they're awakening," Astrid explained, carefully wrapping the staff in specially treated cloth that muffled but didn't eliminate its musical emanations. "The old knowledge recognizes that it's needed again. But staying here much longer risks attracting unwanted attention."

"What kind of attention?" Greta asked, her tactical instincts immediately alert to potential threats.

"The kind that considers awakened artifacts dangerous rather than valuable," Astrid replied grimly. "Imperial regulations classify singing runes as possible demonic corruption. Church doctrine forbids magical practices that don't require divine blessing. And Guild policy demands that all powerful artifacts be registered and controlled."

"Meaning we're harboring contraband," Willi observed practically. "How long before someone notices?"

"Not long," Astrid admitted. "Which is why I need to return to the Wild Lands soon. The question is whether you're willing to come with me."

The directness of her offer caught them all off guard. Lin felt her friends exchange glances that carried entire conversations about responsibilities, risks, and opportunities that might never come again.

"What exactly would we be getting into?" Greta asked, her strategic mind demanding specifics before committing to any course of action.

"A journey into territories where the old knowledge is preserved and practiced," Astrid replied. "Places where you could learn techniques that Academy training never covers. But also regions where Imperial law doesn't apply and survival depends on understanding dynamics that your education hasn't prepared you for."

"Sounds dangerous," Tobi said, though his tone suggested he found that appealing rather than discouraging.

"Everything worthwhile is dangerous," Astrid replied with a slight smile. "The question is whether the potential rewards justify the risks involved."

Lin found herself thinking about her grandmother's stories, about traditions that connected practitioners to the living world rather than treating magic as a resource to be extracted and controlled. The brief contact with the antler staff had shown her possibilities that Academy training couldn't provide, but it had also revealed how much she didn't understand about the forces she was trying to work with.

"How long would we be gone?" Willi asked, always focused on practical considerations.

"Depends on how quickly you learn and how much the situation deteriorates," Astrid replied honestly. "Could be weeks, could be months. The Wild Lands operate on different timescales than Academy schedules."

That evening, they gathered in Lin's workshop to discuss the proposal without Astrid present. The conversation that followed revealed how much their priorities had shifted since their early days as Academy students focused primarily on Guild contracts and career advancement.

"It's a chance to learn things we can't learn anywhere else," Lin said, articulating what she suspected they were all thinking. "Techniques that might help with the magical instabilities we've been tracking."

"Also a chance to get killed in territories where the Guild can't protect us," Greta pointed out, though her tone suggested she was considering pros and cons rather than dismissing the idea entirely.

"The Guild protection hasn't been particularly effective lately anyway," Tobi observed. "We've been handling problems that supposedly required senior mages to resolve."

"Because we work well together," Willi said. "But working well in controlled environments doesn't guarantee success in chaotic ones."

"True," Lin admitted. "But staying safe also means staying ignorant about techniques that might be crucial for the challenges we're facing."

The debate continued late into the night, covering everything from supply logistics to communication protocols with the Academy. But underneath the practical concerns, Lin sensed a deeper consensus buildingâ€”they were all curious about what lay beyond the boundaries of conventional magical education.

The decision crystallized the next morning when reports arrived of a major magical disaster in the northwestern border city of Grenzfeld. The entire settlement had been evacuated after layline corruption created a zone where spells either failed completely or exploded with unpredictable effects.

"Academy mages tried standard purification rituals," the messenger explained to Guild representatives while Lin's group listened from nearby. "But the corruption just spread. They're calling it impossible to fix."

"Impossible with Academy techniques," Astrid said quietly to Lin. "But the old ways include methods for healing damaged laylines that predate the corruption patterns modern magic creates."

"You think what we might learn could help with problems like this?" Greta asked, immediately grasping the strategic implications.

"I think the techniques you could learn might be the only thing that can help with problems like this," Astrid replied seriously. "Which is why the old knowledge needs to survive and spread."

That afternoon, they met with Academy administration to request extended leave for "advanced magical research in collaboration with northern clan practitioners." The request raised eyebrows and required careful explanation, but their track record of successful problem-solving eventually secured approval.

"Just remember that you'll be representing the Academy," Master Korven warned during their final meeting. "Your actions reflect on our institution's reputation and relationships with regional authorities."

"We understand," Greta replied formally, though Lin noticed she didn't make any specific promises about what they would or wouldn't do.

The process of preparing for departure revealed how much their equipment and approach had evolved since their early days as Stone-rank adventurers. Instead of standard Guild-issued gear, they now carried specialized tools adapted to their individual strengths and collaborative methods.

Lin packed her expanding collection of brewing equipment along with samples of every potion formula she'd successfully developed. Her blackthorn staff had been reinforced with additional protective enchantments, while her herb collection included several specimens that conventional botany couldn't explain.

Willi organized their supplies with characteristic efficiency, balancing weight considerations against the reality that they would be traveling in regions where resupply might be impossible. Her elemental magic had developed beyond simple offensive applications to include environmental adaptations that could make survival easier in hostile territory.

Tobi prepared for the social and reconnaissance challenges they were likely to face, upgrading his equipment to include tools for information gathering and negotiation. His enhanced reflexes from Lin's stamina potion had worn off, but the experience had shown him possibilities for magical enhancement that conventional training didn't cover.

Greta approached the journey as a military operation, creating contingency plans for various scenarios while ensuring that their group dynamics could handle the stress of operating in unfamiliar territory. Her faith in the Light had expanded to encompass concepts that Church doctrine didn't traditionally address.

"Are we sure about this?" Willi asked as they made final preparations. "Once we leave Academy protection, we're committed to whatever we find out there."

"We're sure that staying safe and staying ignorant aren't viable long-term strategies," Lin replied. "The magical problems we've been seeing aren't going to solve themselves."

"Plus," Tobi added with characteristic optimism, "how often do you get the chance to learn techniques that supposedly don't exist?"

"That's what worries me," Greta said, though she was smiling. "But I suppose someone has to find out whether the stories are true."

The night before departure, they shared a farewell dinner with Academy friends and faculty who wished them well while clearly thinking they were embarking on a dangerous mistake. The conversations were warm but carried an undercurrent of uncertainty about when or whether they would return.

"Just remember that the Academy will be here when you get back," Master Korven said during his farewell toast. "Knowledge grows through exploration, but wisdom requires knowing when to return home."

"We'll remember," Lin promised, though she suspected that what they learned in the Wild Lands might change their definition of home in ways none of them could currently predict.

As dawn broke over Eisenstadt, they gathered at the northern gates where Astrid waited with horses and supplies for the journey ahead. The morning mist seemed to carry promises of adventure and discovery, but also warnings about challenges that academic training couldn't prepare them for.

"Ready?" Astrid asked, studying their faces for any signs of last-minute hesitation.

"As ready as anyone can be for venturing into the unknown," Lin replied, feeling her friends' presence as a steady anchor for whatever lay ahead.

The Wild Lands stretched beyond the Empire's borders like an invitation to discover what lay beyond the boundaries of conventional understanding. Whatever they found there would change them, but Lin felt confident that facing the unknown together was preferable to staying safe while the world's magical foundations continued deteriorating around them.

"Then let's see what the old knowledge has to teach," Astrid said with satisfaction, leading them toward territories where different rules applied and ancient secrets waited to be rediscovered.
