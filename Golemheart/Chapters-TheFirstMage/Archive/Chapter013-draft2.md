# Chapter 13: Threadcraft and City - Draft 2

The afternoon sun cast long shadows as Lin pushed through the heavy oak doors of the Royal Academy's administrative building, her shoulders aching from three days of relentless bureaucratic meetings. The familiar weight of forms and protocols pressed down on her like a physical burden, making every step feel heavier than it should.

"I never want to see another form about 'Magical Infrastructure Liability Assessment' for as long as I live," Willi muttered, rubbing her temples where a persistent headache had taken root. Behind her, Greta emerged with an audible crack as she stretched her arms above her head, while Tobi stumbled slightly, looking as drained as Lin felt from endless discussions about dungeon management protocols and Library Spirit renovations.

Lin stepped into the courtyard expecting the familiar bustle of Academy life, but instead found herself staring at a completely transformed city. The usually quiet streets beyond the Academy gates teemed with activity that made her eyes widen in disbelief. Adventuring parties in mismatched armor clustered around hastily erected merchant stalls, their voices creating a cacophony that echoed off the stone buildings with the intensity of a festival day gone wrong. Guild banners hung from every available surface, fluttering in the afternoon breeze like colorful declarations of territorial claim, while the acrid smell of hastily cooked street food mingled with the metallic tang of weapons being sharpened.

"What in the name of the Luminant happened while we were locked away with paperwork?" Greta breathed, her hand instinctively moving to rest on her sword hilt as she surveyed the chaos with a tactical eye that immediately catalogued potential threats and escape routes.

But Lin barely heard their conversation. Something deeper caught her attention, a wrongness that made her stomach clench with sudden unease and sent ice water through her veins. The laylines she could see threading through the city like faint golden ribbons looked... hurt. They writhed and twisted in patterns that reminded her of a tapestry someone had grabbed and shaken violently, the elegant flow she remembered reduced to chaotic tangles that pulsed with an uncomfortable red tinge. The sight made her breath catch and her hands tremble as she reached for her staff.

"This isn't just about the adventurers," she said, her voice tight with growing concern as she pulled her blackthorn staff from where it hung across her back. The moment her fingers touched the wood, she felt the Forest Spirit within stir with agitation that mirrored her own mounting alarm. "The dungeon's creation damaged something fundamental. The magical infrastructure connecting the entire city is falling apart."

Willi's expression shifted as understanding dawned, her practical mind immediately grasping the implications while her eyes swept the crowded streets with new awareness. "No wonder everything feels off. Inn prices have tripled, there's already talk of food shortages, and I saw at least three different arguments about sanitation in just the walk from the administrative building to here."

They made their way toward the temporary Guild processing station that had been erected in what used to be the peaceful Merchants' Square. The sight that greeted them made Lin's heart sink further. Over forty adventuring parties clustered around tables manned by overwhelmed Guild staff, their conversations a mixture of excitement, frustration, and barely contained aggression. The air crackled with competing magical auras as mages from different traditions sized each other up, while warriors compared weapons and rogues eyed each other with professional suspicion.

Tobi whistled low, understanding dawning in his voice as he watched a group of obvious newcomers arguing loudly with a harried-looking inn keeper whose "NO VACANCY" sign swayed precariously above his door. "Eight days. We survived eight days in there when most of these people haven't even seen the entrance yet."

The realization was interrupted by a familiar voice calling her name. Dean Margarethe approached with quick, purposeful strides, her usually composed expression showing cracks of genuine concern that made the lines around her eyes deeper and her normally perfect posture slightly hunched with stress.

"Miss Lin, thank the Light you're finally available. We have a situation that requires your immediate attention." The Dean's voice carried an urgency that made Lin's pulse quicken and her grip tighten on her staff. "There are reports of monster scouts approaching the city, drawn by magical emanations from the dungeon area. But that's not our most pressing concern right now."

Dean Margarethe led them through streets that felt increasingly surreal as they progressed, each block revealing new impossibilities that made Lin's understanding of magical normalcy stretch and bend. At first, the changes seemed almost whimsical. Street lamps flickered in patterns that resembled morse code, their warm yellow light occasionally accompanied by faint whispers that made passersby pause and look around in confusion, their faces showing the particular bewilderment of people who couldn't quite identify what was wrong. A fountain in the central square overflowed with water that glowed pale blue, its luminescence creating rainbow patterns on the wet cobblestones while droplets that should have fallen instead rose gently into the air before dissolving like morning mist, leaving behind the faint scent of ozone and something that reminded Lin of her grandmother's garden after rain.

But as they moved deeper into the affected areas, the anomalies became more disturbing. Lin watched a bakery owner standing helplessly outside his shop while terrified whimpering sounds echoed from his kitchen, each pitiful cry making the man flinch as if the sound caused him physical pain. His face was pale with exhaustion, and flour dusted his clothes as if he'd been struggling with something for hours, his hands shaking as he wrung his apron.

"The kitchen spirit won't come out," he explained when Dean Margarethe stopped to investigate, his voice cracking with desperation and the kind of bone-deep weariness that came from fighting a battle he couldn't understand. "Started yesterday morning. Won't tend the ovens, won't help with the bread. Just hides and cries. Never seen anything like it in thirty years of baking."

Lin pressed her palm against her staff, feeling the Forest Spirit's consciousness brush against hers like a worried friend seeking comfort. The sensation that followed made her breath catch in her throat as warmth spread up her arm and into her chest. The staff grew warm under her touch, almost hot, and suddenly she could hear something that made her heart ache with sympathy—a sound like crying that came from everywhere and nowhere, the collective anguish of creatures she couldn't see but desperately wanted to help.

"Little witch," the Forest Spirit's voice whispered in her mind, carrying centuries of wisdom tinged with genuine distress that felt like her own panic reflected back at her. "The threads sing with pain. The great awakening tore more than stone—it wounded the web itself."

The words hit Lin like a physical blow as understanding crashed over her with the force of cold water. This wasn't random magical chaos spawned by the dungeon's creation. The spiritual ecosystem that connected every part of the city had been traumatized. The laylines that should flow in harmonious patterns were writhing in pain, and the spirits that tended them were confused, frightened, and unable to fulfill their ancient purposes.

Tobi's street-smart instincts guided him toward the maze of alleyways that branched off from the main thoroughfares. What he found there made him call out with genuine alarm that cut through the afternoon air like a blade. "Lin, you need to see this!"

The alleyways had twisted overnight into configurations that defied both logic and city planning. Streets that Lin remembered as straight passages now curved in impossible spirals that made her eyes water to follow, while dead ends appeared where through-routes should be, creating a maze that seemed designed by someone with a very cruel sense of humor. She watched a local woman with a market basket stand at a corner with tears of frustration streaming down her face, clearly lost in her own neighborhood.

"I've lived here for twenty years," the woman said when Lin approached, her voice thick with the kind of helpless confusion that came from having one's fundamental understanding of the world stripped away. "This was my shortcut to the market. Now I can't find my way anywhere."

Lin extended her awareness through her staff, trying to understand the layline patterns beneath the twisted geography. What she sensed made her stomach lurch with recognition as the magical currents revealed themselves to be knotted into painful tangles that pulled and twisted like infected wounds. The pain of it made her gasp and stumble backward.

Her first instinct was to help, to use the plant magic that had served her so well in the dungeon. She reached out with her will, trying to encourage the laylines to return to their natural flow, but the response was immediate and violent. The magical current snapped back like a released rubber band, sending a shock through her system that made her stagger and sent white-hot pain shooting up her arm. Around them, three street lamps exploded in showers of sparks that rained down on the cobblestones like angry fireflies, filling the air with the acrid smell of burnt metal and ozone.

"Careful!" Greta called out, moving quickly to shield a group of startled pedestrians from the falling glass, her warrior instincts taking over as she positioned herself between the danger and the civilians. "Whatever you just tried, the city didn't like it."

Lin steadied herself against a wall, her mind racing as she processed what had just happened. The laylines weren't just damaged—they were hypersensitive, reacting to any attempted manipulation with defensive violence. Trying to force them back into place would be like trying to comfort a wounded animal by grabbing it roughly.

"This needs a completely different approach," she murmured, her thoughts turning to the desperate night in the dungeon when she'd worked to repair Greta's stolen memories. She'd used something then, a different kind of magic that worked with connections rather than commanding them. "Not force, but careful restoration and connection."

Lin found a quiet corner of the Academy's inner courtyard, settling cross-legged on the worn stone with her blackthorn staff across her knees. The familiar weight of the wood felt different now, almost expectant, as if it too sensed that something important was about to happen. The late afternoon sun warmed her face, and she could hear the distant sounds of the city's chaos, but here in this protected space, she felt calm enough to attempt what she needed to do.

She closed her eyes and let her awareness sink into the staff, seeking the Forest Spirit's ancient consciousness. What she found was a presence both patient and excited, like a teacher who had been waiting for the right moment to share a crucial lesson, its eagerness vibrating through the wood and into her bones.

"I need to understand," she whispered to the spirit, her voice barely audible even to herself. "How do I help them without making things worse?"

The response was unlike anything she'd experienced before. The staff began to change under her hands, and she opened her eyes to watch in fascination as the familiar blackthorn wood flowed like water while maintaining its essential strength. The transformation was mesmerizing—she could feel the wood shifting and reshaping itself, warm and alive under her palms, as the single staff divided and reshaped itself with liquid grace.

What emerged made her breath catch in wonder. Two elegant knitting needles lay across her palms, their surfaces covered in living wood grain that pulsed with gentle green light like a heartbeat made visible. Runes she didn't recognize spiraled along their length in patterns that seemed to shift and dance when she wasn't looking directly at them, creating an optical illusion that made her eyes water if she tried to focus too hard.

"Threadcraft," she breathed, the word coming to her lips without conscious thought, feeling right in a way that made her chest warm with recognition. "It's not metaphor. It's actual weaving."

The needles felt perfectly balanced in her hands, their weight and texture exactly right for the work ahead, as if they had been crafted specifically for her grip and her purpose. She lifted them experimentally, and immediately became aware of invisible threads stretching between everything around her. The connections were faint but real—lines of relationship that bound the courtyard stones to the ancient tree growing at its center, threads of shared purpose linking the Academy buildings to the knowledge they contained, delicate strands of emotional connection flowing between every person who had ever found peace in this quiet space.

Lin began to experiment, using the enchanted needles to literally knit patterns in the air. The movements felt natural despite being completely new, as if her hands remembered skills her mind had never learned. At first, her stitches were clumsy and uncertain, but gradually she found a rhythm that felt like breathing, like her heartbeat, like something fundamental to her existence.

The laylines responded to her touch, not with the violent rejection she'd experienced before, but with cautious curiosity, like shy animals venturing closer to investigate a potential friend. She could feel their confusion and pain, but also their desperate hope for relief, and the combination made tears well up in her eyes.

But her early attempts created more tangles than they solved. She was still thinking like a gardener, trying to force growth and change instead of working with the existing patterns. Frustration mounted as she watched her careful stitches dissolve into chaos, the magical threads slipping away from her control like water through her fingers. The failure made her chest tight with disappointment and her hands shake with the effort of trying harder when trying harder was exactly the wrong approach.

"This is impossible," she muttered, setting the needles down with more force than necessary, the click of wood against stone sharp in the quiet courtyard. "I don't know what I'm doing."

"Mind if I sit?" Willi's voice came from behind her, warm with the kind of gentle concern that made Lin's chest tight with gratitude and relief at not being alone with her failure.

Lin gestured to the stone beside her, and Willi settled down with a soft sigh of relief, her presence immediately making the space feel safer and more manageable. For a moment, they sat in comfortable silence while Willi studied the transformed needles with thoughtful interest, her expression showing none of the judgment Lin feared.

"You know," Willi said eventually, her voice carrying the careful tone she used when offering advice without seeming to lecture, "when I first started cooking, I made the same mistake everyone makes. I thought I could force ingredients to work together through sheer determination and precise technique." Her small smile held the memory of her own struggles and failures.

Lin looked up, sensing there was more to the story and grateful for anything that might help her understand.

"Took me years to understand that cooking isn't about commanding ingredients," Willi continued, her voice growing warmer as she shared the hard-won wisdom. "It's about understanding their nature and helping them want to work together. You can't make oil and vinegar become friends, but you can give them a good reason to cooperate."

The words hit Lin like a revelation, reshaping her entire approach in an instant. She picked up the needles again, but this time instead of trying to impose order on the laylines, she simply listened. The magical currents had their own preferences, their own natural flows that had been disrupted but not destroyed. Her job wasn't to create new patterns but to gently guide the existing ones back into harmony.

The change in approach made all the difference. Instead of forcing the threads into rigid configurations, she helped them remember their preferred arrangements, coaxing and encouraging rather than commanding. The laylines responded with what felt almost like relief, their chaotic writhing gradually settling into smoother flows that hummed with contentment.

Her first successful threadcraft created a small area of calm around the courtyard fountain. The water stopped its unnatural glowing and returned to its clear, steady flow, the sound of it splashing against stone suddenly musical instead of discordant. Birds that had been absent for days returned to perch on the fountain's edge, their songs bright and cheerful in the afternoon air, and the very atmosphere seemed to breathe easier, as if a weight had been lifted from the world itself.

Lin was so focused on her work, so absorbed in the delicate dance of guiding magical currents back into harmony, that she didn't notice the approaching footsteps until Captain Weber's authoritative voice cut through her concentration like a blade.

"Miss Lin." The captain's tone carried a mixture of respect and barely controlled frustration that made Lin's shoulders tense immediately. "I need you to stop whatever magical experimentation you're conducting immediately."

Lin looked up to find herself surrounded by city officials whose faces showed varying degrees of worry, suspicion, and barely contained panic. Captain Weber stood with three city councilors whose expressions ranged from worried to openly hostile, while behind them, a small crowd of curious onlookers had gathered, their faces showing the kind of wary attention usually reserved for potential disasters.

"The city is already dealing with unprecedented magical disruption," one of the councilors said, his voice tight with anxiety and the kind of fear that came from watching one's orderly world dissolve into chaos. "We cannot afford to have additional experimental magic making the situation worse."

Greta stepped forward before Lin could respond, her posture shifting into the kind of dramatic stance that usually preceded her most theatrical moments. The afternoon light caught the feather in her helm and the polished surface of her armor, making her look every inch the heroic knight from the old stories.

"Behold!" she declared, her voice carrying easily across the courtyard with the trained projection of someone accustomed to addressing crowds and making grand pronouncements. "The First Witch's magic is not the cause but the cure for these ailments!"

As if summoned by her words, a tremendous crash echoed from somewhere beyond the Academy walls, the sound rolling across the city like thunder made of breaking stone and screaming metal. The ground beneath their feet trembled, and Lin felt the laylines she'd been carefully tending suddenly shriek with renewed anguish that made her cry out and clutch her needles to her chest. In the distance, they could see an entire block of houses rearranging themselves like pieces in a three-dimensional puzzle, walls sliding past each other while rooftops rotated into impossible angles that hurt to look at.

The sight seemed to drain some of the hostility from the officials' faces, replacing it with the kind of desperate fear that came from watching one's world slip beyond comprehension or control.

"I can help," Lin said, rising to her feet with the needles still clutched in her hands, her voice steady despite the way her heart hammered against her ribs. "Let me show you what threadcraft can do."

Captain Weber exchanged glances with the councilors before giving a reluctant nod. "Controlled demonstration only. Any sign this is making things worse, and we stop immediately."

Lin moved to the center of the courtyard, closing her eyes for a moment to center herself and push down the anxiety that threatened to make her hands shake. When she opened them again, she raised the needles and began to work, but this time, instead of hiding her process, she made it visible for everyone to see.

She traced connection patterns in the air with slow, deliberate movements, showing how the laylines should flow between the Academy's central tower, the city's main gate, and the ancient oak that marked the geographic heart of Eisenstadt. The magical threads became visible as she worked, shimmering like spider silk caught in morning sunlight, creating a web of connections that pulsed with gentle light.

The damage was more extensive than she'd realized. As her awareness expanded, she could sense that the entire civic infrastructure was magically interconnected through bonds that had taken centuries to establish. The dungeon's violent birth hadn't just broken individual connections—it had shattered the trust between the city's human institutions and the spiritual forces that supported them.

Tobi, sensing the mood of the crowd with his street-smart instincts, stepped in with the kind of easy charm that made people want to listen to him. "You're watching something that's never been done before," he told the gathered officials and onlookers, his voice carrying just enough theatrical flair to hold their attention without seeming to mock their concerns. "Lin isn't just fixing magical problems—she's healing relationships that most people don't even know exist."

As he spoke, Lin's threadcraft began to show visible results. The nearest street lamps stopped their erratic flickering and settled into steady, warm light that cast comforting shadows instead of the harsh, dancing patterns that had been making people nervous. The fountain's water cleared completely, returning to its natural crystal clarity, and the first birds began to sing from the old oak's branches, their melodies sweet and clear in the afternoon air.

Most importantly, the oppressive weight of wrongness that had hung over the area began to lift, replaced by something that felt like the city taking its first easy breath in days. The change was so palpable that several people in the crowd sighed audibly, their shoulders relaxing as tension they'd been carrying without realizing it finally eased.

One by one, the officials' expressions shifted from suspicion to cautious hope as they witnessed the immediate positive effects of Lin's work.

"Remarkable," Captain Weber said quietly, her professional assessment overriding her initial skepticism as she watched the transformation with the eye of someone trained to evaluate practical results. "The practical applications for city management could be extraordinary."

Lin was about to respond when a new voice cut through the crowd's murmur of amazement.

"Miss Lin." Professor Valdris approached with his usual purposeful stride, flanked by a team of Academy mages whose robes were covered in detection crystals and measurement devices that glinted in the afternoon light. "I must insist that you cease all experimental magical work until proper documentation and theoretical framework can be established."

The tension between academic procedure and urgent necessity crackled in the air like static electricity. Lin found herself caught between two forces, each representing valid but incompatible needs, feeling the weight of expectation and responsibility pressing down on her shoulders.

"What if we do both?" she said, the idea forming as she spoke, her voice gaining confidence as the solution crystallized in her mind. "I'll teach threadcraft principles to Academy mages while we work on the city repairs. That way we can document everything and train support staff at the same time."

Professor Valdris looked skeptical, but Dean Margarethe nodded with relief that was visible in the way her shoulders dropped and her expression softened. "A reasonable compromise. Professor, surely even you can see the value in practical field research under controlled conditions."

The next few hours proved both enlightening and frustrating as Lin found herself trying to teach threadcraft to Academy mages whose entire magical education was based on command and control. The fundamental difference in approach created a barrier that seemed almost insurmountable.

"No, you're still trying to force the layline into a predetermined pattern," she explained for the fourth time to a frustrated graduate student whose face was red with effort and embarrassment. "You need to listen to what it wants first, then help it find its way there."

The student, a serious young man whose mage robes bore the insignia of advanced elemental studies, shook his head in confusion that bordered on distress. "But Professor Valdris taught us that successful spellcraft requires precise manipulation of magical forces according to established principles. You're asking us to treat the laylines like they have personalities."

"Because they do," Lin said simply, then realized how that must sound to someone trained in Western magical theory. "Not personalities exactly, but preferences. Natural flows and connections that work better when you cooperate with them instead of commanding them."

After several more failed attempts that left both teacher and students frustrated, Lin had an inspiration. She sent Tobi to the Academy workshops with a request for special lenses designed to enhance layline visibility. When he returned with a collection of experimental goggles originally designed for advanced magical research, several of the more gifted students finally began to grasp what she was showing them.

"I can see them," one student whispered in amazement, adjusting her borrowed goggles as she watched the laylines flow through the courtyard like rivers of light. "They're like... like rivers of light, but they have currents and eddies just like water. And they're... they're moving toward harmony on their own. They want to be fixed."

With this breakthrough, Lin was able to train a small support team of Academy students who could assist with the larger repair work. Their threadcraft was basic and required careful supervision, but it was enough to extend her influence to multiple sites simultaneously.

The progress was interrupted by a Guild messenger whose arrival sent a chill through the assembled group. Monster scout groups had been spotted within a day's march of the city, and their approach seemed to be accelerating as they drew closer to the chaotic magical emanations still radiating from the damaged layline network.

Lin stared up at the afternoon sky, watching the sun sink lower toward the horizon as she calculated distances and time with growing alarm. Piecemeal repairs wouldn't be enough. If they were going to prevent the approaching monsters from complicating an already desperate situation, she needed to restore the entire city's layline network before nightfall.

The scale of the task was overwhelming, but as she looked around at her friends, she realized they'd already begun organizing themselves into the kind of coordinated effort that had seen them through the dungeon's depths.

Greta took charge of city officials and crowd control with the natural authority that made people want to follow her lead, her voice carrying clearly across the courtyard as she organized evacuation routes and safety protocols. Tobi managed communication between work sites, his combination of charm and street smarts perfect for keeping information flowing smoothly between diverse groups who might otherwise have trouble working together. Willi provided magical support and made sure Lin stayed fed and hydrated during what promised to be exhausting work, appearing at her elbow with strengthening potions and sandwiches that tasted like comfort and determination.

"We can do this," Lin said, as much to convince herself as to encourage the others, her voice steady despite the magnitude of what lay ahead. "The Academy students can work as proxies, extending my influence to distant locations while I coordinate from the central nexus points."

What followed was the most ambitious magical working Lin had ever attempted. Using her transformed staff as a coordination focus, she reached out to touch laylines throughout the city while Academy students with basic threadcraft training served as her hands and eyes at distant locations.

The sensation was unlike anything she'd experienced before—simultaneously exhilarating and terrifying as her consciousness expanded to encompass the spiritual geography of an entire city. She could feel every damaged connection, every frightened spirit, every place where the magical infrastructure had been wounded by the dungeon's violent birth. The pain of it was overwhelming, but so was the potential for healing.

As she worked to untangle centuries of accumulated damage, she began to experience feedback from the city spirits whose pain and confusion had been building for days. Their trauma flooded through her awareness like a tide of emotional overwhelm—fear, loneliness, anger, and desperate hope all mixing together until she could barely distinguish her own thoughts from theirs.

The Forest Spirit in her staff provided stability, its ancient consciousness serving as an anchor point that kept her from being swept away entirely. But even its support came with warnings that made her hands tremble as she worked.

"Little witch," the spirit's voice whispered with gentle urgency that felt like a warm hand on her shoulder, "you weave not just threads but destinies. What you repair will remember your touch. This work creates bonds that cannot easily be broken."

Lin understood the warning with crystal clarity. She wasn't just fixing a temporary problem—she was making herself integral to the city's spiritual health. The laylines she restored would carry her magical signature, and the spirits she comforted would remember her touch. This was more than healing; it was the creation of ongoing responsibility that would shape the rest of her life.

But as she felt the city's pain begin to ease under her touch, she knew there was no other choice. The work was necessary, and she was the only one who could do it.

The restoration process created visible results throughout Eisenstadt that rippled outward from each repaired connection point like stones dropped in still water. Spirits that had been hiding in fear began to emerge, expressing their gratitude through small improvements that made the city feel alive again. The weather cleared, with oppressive clouds giving way to gentle sunshine that warmed the stones and made the air smell clean and fresh. Plants throughout the city straightened and brightened, showing new growth that shouldn't have been possible so late in the season but somehow felt perfectly natural.

Most importantly for the immediate crisis, the chaotic magical emanations that had been drawing monsters toward the city gradually faded to normal levels. By evening, scouts reported that the approaching creature groups had become confused and disoriented, their supernatural navigation disrupted by the sudden absence of the beacon that had been guiding them.

As sunset painted the sky in shades of gold and rose, Lin finally allowed herself to rest. She sat in the central courtyard with her friends, her transformed staff once again in its familiar single form, watching the city settle into something that felt like peace for the first time in days. The exhaustion was bone-deep, but it was the good kind of tiredness that came from work well done and problems solved.

Dean Margarethe approached with an expression that mixed exhaustion with genuine admiration, her usually perfect composure softened by relief and wonder. "Miss Lin, the city council and Academy administration have reached a consensus. We would like to offer you a permanent consultant position with unprecedented freedoms and responsibilities. Your threadcraft abilities appear to be essential for maintaining the magical infrastructure that supports our community."

Lin nodded, unsurprised by the offer but still feeling the weight of what it meant settling around her shoulders like a mantle of responsibility. "I'll need to write to Duke Wilhelm first. I promised to keep him informed of everything I learned, and this definitely qualifies."

As her friends helped her to her feet and they began the walk back to the Academy dormitories, Lin's mind was already composing the letter she would need to send. How did you explain to a Duke that you'd accidentally become integral to the spiritual well-being of an entire city? How did you describe threadcraft and layline healing to someone who lived three days' journey away but deserved to understand the implications for regional magical stability?

Meanwhile, in his study overlooking the gardens of Königshafen, Duke Wilhelm von Königshafen set down the latest report from his network of informants and rubbed his temples against a mounting headache that had been building for three solid days. The carved wooden desk before him was covered with increasingly bizarre accounts from Eisenstadt, each one more impossible than the last.

First, reports of a magical dungeon appearing beneath the Royal Academy—strange enough on its own. Then descriptions of massive infrastructure disruption and an influx of adventurers that had transformed the quiet academic city into something resembling a chaotic frontier town. Now his most trusted sources were sending him accounts of a young witch performing city-wide magical healing using techniques no one had heard of before, techniques that apparently worked where traditional magic failed.

When the Duke's secretary knocked and announced the arrival of an official letter bearing Lin Xiu's seal, Wilhelm felt his headache intensify. The familiar green wax seal seemed to mock him with its cheerful efficiency, promising yet another impossibility that he would somehow need to understand and respond to appropriately.

He broke the wax seal with careful deliberation, already dreading what new impossibility the First Witch would present him with this time, and wondering how many more surprises his understanding of magic and politics could absorb before something fundamental broke.
