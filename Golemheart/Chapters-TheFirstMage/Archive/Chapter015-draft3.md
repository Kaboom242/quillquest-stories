# Chapter 15: The Haunted Bridge - Draft 3

Lin breathed deeply as her horse crested the final hill before the Silberbach valley, savoring air that tasted properly of summer grass instead of the metallic corruption they'd left behind at Rowan Hollow. Her muscles finally unknotted from the tension of working so close to layline torture, and she let herself appreciate the clean morning light that turned the surrounding farmland into gold and emerald patches.

The reprieve lasted exactly until she extended her magical senses toward their destination and felt the tangle waiting ahead—not the screaming agony of corrupted magic, but something that pulled at her chest with the weight of old grief and unfinished business.

"Bridge has been impassable for five days," Willi said, unfolding their contract against her saddle horn with the methodical attention she brought to all their jobs. "Merchants report seeing figures that vanish when approached, and water that speaks in voices of the drowned." Her frown suggested she found the latter claim particularly dubious. "Local garrison tried to clear it twice, but their horses refuse to set hoof on the stones."

Tobi strummed a melody that bounced cheerfully off the hills around them. "Horses have more sense than most soldiers. They can smell death magic from a mile away, unlike humans who require actual corpses before asking uncomfortable questions."

As they descended toward the river, Lin watched the bridge resolve from distant smudge to detailed architecture. Five graceful stone arches should have carried travelers safely across the Silberbach's summer flow. Instead, frost glittered along railings that should have been warm with afternoon sun, and mist rose from dark water in spirals that defied every natural law Lin knew.

Pale figures moved back and forth across the span like moths trapped against glass, their movements visible even from half a mile away. Something about their desperate repetition made Lin's throat tighten with sympathetic anguish. These weren't the chaotic flailings of corrupted spirits—they moved with purpose, as if eternally searching for something just beyond their reach.

"The Light has shown me visions of restless spirits in my prayers," Greta said, her armor creaking as she studied the haunted span ahead. "Souls trapped between this world and the next, unable to find peace." Her voice carried the weight of experience with such hauntings. "They often manifest near water, which holds memories longer than stone or earth."

The south approach to the bridge had become an impromptu camp where frustrated travelers waited for passage that might never come. Lin dismounted near a weathered merchant whose wagon sat heavy with goods bound for northern markets, his face carrying the exhausted frustration of someone forced to watch the same impossible sight for too many days.

"Started right after the big storm passed through," he told her when she asked about the haunting. His voice held the hollow quality of someone who'd told this story too many times. "Water rose faster than anyone's seen in living memory—came down from the mountains like a wall. When it finally went down again, they were there." His pointing finger trembled slightly as he indicated the ghostly figures. "Keep reaching for something in the water, searching and searching, but they can't quite touch whatever it is."

Lin left her horse with the others and approached the bridge itself, immediately feeling the wrongness that had spooked every animal for miles. The temperature dropped with each step toward the stone approach, the chill biting through her summer clothes like winter wind sharp enough to cut skin. Her breath began coming out in white puffs despite the afternoon sun warming her shoulders, and frost crunched under her boots where it had no business existing.

The laylines beneath the ancient stones felt tangled but not corrupted when she extended her magical senses toward them—twisted into knots that spoke of sudden violence and desperate urgency rather than the deliberate torture she'd experienced at Rowan Hollow. When she pressed deeper with her consciousness, images flashed through her mind: dark water rushing higher than it should have been possible, desperate voices calling over the thunder of flash flood, reaching hands that couldn't quite span the distance to something precious being swept away by the merciless current.

"There was a tragedy here," she said, the certainty settling cold and heavy in her chest. "Something sudden that left them unable to move on. But they're not feeding on the laylines like the corrupted tree was—they're just stuck, trapped by something they couldn't finish."

Tobi's lute sang a soft, questioning melody into the unnatural chill, and Lin watched one of the ghostly figures pause in its endless pacing to turn toward the sound. For one heartbreaking moment, features resolved from pale mist—a young woman's face marked with desperate longing and unbearable sadness, hope and terror warring in eyes that seemed to look directly at Lin before dissolving back into translucent fog.

"Music draws them," Lin realized, her voice barely above a whisper as understanding began to crystallize. "They're still connected to the living world somehow. That's why they can't pass on—something's anchoring them here, something they need to finish."

As afternoon wore toward evening and shadows lengthened across the valley, the spirits became more solid, their movements more frantic. Lin could now make out details she'd missed from a distance—travel cloaks that rippled in no earthly wind, sturdy boots that left no prints on frost-covered stone, the practical garments of people caught by disaster while journeying far from home.

A ghostly man in a leather coat paced the bridge's center, repeatedly examining something cupped in his translucent hands while his face twisted with anguish that made Lin's chest ache. Near the northern end, two women held what might have been a length of rope, their mouths moving in conversation no living ear could hear.

The breakthrough came as true dusk approached and the temperature around the bridge plummeted until thick ice began forming on the stone railings. Lin pressed close enough to the haunted span that her skin stung with supernatural cold, straining to catch fragments of voices that drifted like whispers carried on wind that touched nothing but her ears:

"—find the rope, someone find the rope—"
"—too deep, water's too deep, can't reach—"
"—baby's crying, dear Light, where's the baby—"

The words hit Lin like a physical blow, stealing her breath and sending ice through her veins that had nothing to do with the unnatural chill. Understanding crashed over her with horrible clarity, each piece of the puzzle falling into place with the weight of a gravestone.

"They're not the ones who died," she whispered, horror and pity warring in her chest as she stared at the desperate spirits. "They're the ones who lived through it. They're trying to save someone who's still down there."

She pointed with a shaking hand toward the water beneath the bridge's central arch, where current ran deepest and swiftest around obstacles she couldn't see. "There's someone in the river. Someone they couldn't save when the flood hit, and now they're trapped here trying to finish the rescue. They've been searching for five days straight, reaching for someone who's beyond any mortal help."

The implications made her stomach turn with nausea that had nothing to do with magical corruption. Seven people had survived whatever catastrophe struck this bridge, but their inability to save one person—one baby, if the ghostly voices spoke true—had bound them here more completely than any curse.

Greta strode toward the bridge with purpose that made her armor ring like funeral bells. "Then we finish what they started," she declared, her voice carrying the absolute conviction that had always marked her dedication to protecting the innocent. "No soul should be lost when help is possible, whether they draw breath or not."

But as Lin took her first step onto the frost-slicked stones of the bridge approach, the ghostly figures turned toward her with expressions that made her heart clench with sympathetic pain. Seven souls reached out with translucent hands, their desperate need pressing against her consciousness like a physical weight. Wild hope blazed in their spectral faces, but underneath it lurked terrible fear—the terror of people who had failed once and couldn't bear to fail again.

The question burning in Lin's mind as she stepped onto the haunted span was whether she could give them the closure they craved, or if she was about to become the eighth spirit trapped on the Silberbach bridge, forever searching the dark water for something that could never be saved.

The river beneath ran swift and merciless, keeping whatever secrets it held in depths where seven living people had once reached in vain, and where their spirits still searched with the desperate persistence of love that refused to accept defeat, even when defeat was all that remained.
