# Chapter 17: Northern Runes - Draft 2

The morning light streaming through the Academy dormitory windows warmed Lin's face as she woke, carrying with it the familiar sounds of Eisenstadt's transformed streets. Merchant voices called out prices for dungeon supplies while wagon wheels rattled over cobblestones, a symphony of commerce that had replaced the city's former quiet rhythms.

Lin stretched and made her way to the window, where the sight of bustling market stalls brought a smile to her lips. After weeks of magical crises and supernatural emergencies, watching normal people go about normal business felt like the most precious gift imaginable.

She dressed quickly and headed for the Academy's expanded kitchens, where the scent of brewing potions mixed with the aroma of fresh bread. The Library Spirit's renovations had created the perfect space for her experiments—multiple brewing stations with proper ventilation, temperature-controlled storage alcoves, and workspace that seemed to arrange itself helpfully whenever she needed a specific tool.

Willi was already there, efficiently managing breakfast while keeping one eye on a simmering pot that held Lin's latest healing draught. Steam rose from the mixture in precise spirals, the silver vapor carrying the sharp scent of willow bark and something that smelled faintly of thunderstorms.

"Morning," Willi said without looking up from the eggs she was scrambling. "Your stamina potion finished brewing an hour ago, but breakfast comes first. Empty stomachs make for unreliable magical experiments."

Lin accepted a plate of perfectly prepared food, marveling as always at how Willi could make simple ingredients taste exceptional. The eggs were creamy and rich, the bread still warm from the oven, and the tea carried just enough honey to complement its earthy flavor.

"Any volunteers for testing today?" Lin asked.

"Tobi's been dropping hints about wanting to try the energy restoration brew," Willi replied, her tone suggesting she found this amusing rather than surprising. "Though I suspect he's more interested in impressing you with his willingness to risk magical side effects than actually needing stamina enhancement."

As if summoned by their conversation, Tobi appeared in the doorway with his usual theatrical entrance. His hair looked like he'd made some effort to tame it, though several rebellious strands still defied gravity in ways that somehow managed to be charming.

"Did someone mention my legendary bravery in the face of potentially dangerous magical experimentation?" he asked, sliding into a chair with practiced grace. "Because I should point out that volunteering to test untested potions is genuinely heroic. I'm basically risking my devastatingly handsome face for the advancement of science."

Lin rolled her eyes while Willi placed a plate before him. "We were discussing whether you're actually brave or just showing off."

"Can't it be both?" Tobi grinned, then took a bite of eggs that made his expression shift to genuine appreciation. "Willi, you're a miracle worker. How do you make everything taste this good?"

Before Willi could respond, the distinctive sound of armor in the hallway announced Greta's approach. She entered already fully equipped for the day, her blonde hair neatly braided and her surcoat bearing the Luminant Church's symbol freshly polished.

"Good morning," she said, accepting breakfast with a grateful nod. "I've spoken with the Guild representatives about our recent contracts. They're quite pleased with our layline repair work, and several other cities have requested similar assistance."

Lin felt warmth spread through her chest. After weeks of feeling like she was improvising solutions to problems beyond her training, knowing their efforts had actually helped people felt deeply satisfying.

"Any specific requests?" she asked.

"Three towns reporting layline disturbances, two with unexplained spirit manifestations, and something about a haunted mill." Greta consulted a small notebook. "All well within our capabilities, and the pay is excellent."

"I vote for the haunted mill," Tobi said immediately. "Mills always have the best stories, and there might be a mysterious miller's daughter in need of rescue."

"The request specifically mentions that the miller's family fled three weeks ago," Greta said dryly. "So your romantic fantasies will have to wait."

After breakfast, Lin gathered several junior Academy students who had been pestering her about learning potioncraft. The brewing classroom filled with eager young faces, their excitement palpable as they arranged themselves around her main workstation.

"Potioncraft isn't like Academy magic," Lin began, transforming her staff into a large ladle for stirring. "You can't force ingredients to do what you want. You have to listen to what they're trying to tell you."

She demonstrated with a simple healing draught, adding ingredients in careful sequence while explaining how the willow bark needed to simmer at exactly the right temperature to release its beneficial properties without becoming bitter.

The first student, a earnest young man named Klaus, tried to replicate her movements exactly. His mixture turned an alarming shade of purple and began smoking ominously.

"The herbs are fighting each other," Lin said, quickly neutralizing his brew before it could do anything dangerous. "You're treating them like spell components instead of living things with their own nature."

The second attempt, by a girl named Margarete, produced something that resembled soup more than medicine. The third student managed to create a potion that smelled like old socks and made the entire room reek for ten minutes.

By the time they'd worked through six different students, Lin had developed deep sympathy for every teacher who'd ever tried to explain something that felt natural to them. The students were intelligent and eager, but they kept approaching potioncraft like Academy magic—precise formulas to be followed exactly rather than living processes to be guided and nurtured.

"It's like trying to teach someone to cook by giving them detailed measurements for love and intuition," Willi observed, having watched the lesson with growing amusement.

"I think I understand the theory," Klaus said, staring at his latest failed attempt. "But how do you know what the ingredients want? They don't talk."

Lin opened her mouth to explain about listening with magical senses, then realized she had no idea how to describe something that felt as natural as breathing. "It's... you have to feel their purpose. Their nature. What they're trying to become."

The blank stares that greeted this explanation suggested she'd failed to clarify anything.

"Perhaps we should practice with simpler recipes," she said finally. "Something more forgiving."

An hour later, she'd admitted defeat. The students had produced a remarkable variety of failed potions—some merely useless, others actively alarming—but nothing that resembled successful healing draughts. The gap between her intuitive approach and their structured Academy training seemed impossible to bridge.

"Don't look so discouraged," Tobi said as the frustrated students filed out. "Teaching is harder than it looks. Besides, now you can test your stamina potion on someone who definitely needs an energy boost."

Lin retrieved the crystal vial from her storage area, where it caught the afternoon light like liquid starlight. The potion had required three days of careful preparation, with precise timing for lunar phases and ingredients harvested at specific moments.

She transformed her staff into a measuring device, the blackthorn wood reshaping itself with calibrated markings. The Forest Spirit within radiated amused approval, its presence a warm certainty that steadied her confidence.

"Just a small sip," she instructed. "We can always adjust the dose if needed."

Tobi lifted the vial with mock ceremony. "To the advancement of magical knowledge, and to three brilliant women who somehow tolerate my company." He took a careful sip, then paused as the effects began.

His eyes widened as a faint silver glow began emanating from his skin. When he moved, his actions seemed faster and more precise, as if his reflexes had been enhanced beyond normal human capability.

"This is incredible," he said, his voice carrying genuine wonder beneath the usual playful tone. "I feel like I could run to the next province and back. How long will this last?"

"Two to three hours, depending on your natural magical resistance," Lin said, consulting her notes. "The glow should fade as the effects diminish."

Willi examined Tobi critically. "Any side effects? Nausea, dizziness, sudden urges to compose terrible poetry?"

"I always have urges to compose terrible poetry," Tobi replied. "But no, I feel fantastic. Lin, this is genuinely impressive work."

Before Lin could respond, shouting erupted from the Academy's main courtyard. The voices carried genuine alarm that immediately put them all on alert.

They rushed to the nearest window overlooking the courtyard, where a crowd had gathered around what appeared to be newly arrived travelers. Lin could see horses, loaded packs, and several people gesturing animatedly, but the specific nature of the disturbance wasn't clear from their position.

"Probably another group wanting dungeon access," Greta said, though her tone suggested doubt. "The registration process has been causing disputes all week."

The shouting intensified, and Lin caught fragments that made her magical senses prickle: "glowing," "singing," and "won't stop."

"That doesn't sound like paperwork," she said, already moving toward the door. "Something magical is happening."

They made their way quickly through the Academy's corridors and into the courtyard, where the scene that greeted them made Lin's awareness immediately alert. A travel-stained party of five northerners stood near the main entrance, their horses stamping nervously while Guild representatives attempted to maintain order among growing crowds of onlookers.

Lin's attention fixed on the source of disturbance: one traveler carried a leather satchel that pulsed with irregular silver light, while the air around it hummed with musical tones that seemed to resonate directly with the damaged laylines beneath the Academy.

The satchel's bearer was a weathered woman with intricate braids and clothing that spoke of northern clan traditions. Her face showed calm competence, but Lin could see tension in her posture, as if she struggled to control whatever was contained in that glowing bag.

"It started singing three miles outside the city," the woman was explaining to a Guild representative who looked increasingly overwhelmed. "Never done anything like this before. The runes have been quiet for generations, but the moment we approached your Academy, they began resonating."

Lin felt her pulse quicken. Runes. The woman had said runes, which meant this wasn't random magical interference but something connected to traditions that predated the Academy entirely.

She stepped forward, her friends close behind. "Excuse me," she said to the clan woman. "I'm Lin Xiu. I've been working with layline disturbances in this area. May I examine what you're carrying? I might be able to help."

The woman's eyes assessed Lin with rapid evaluation that spoke of long experience judging competence and trustworthiness. Whatever she saw satisfied her, because she nodded slowly.

"Astrid Ironweaver," she said. "These are clan artifacts we're bringing to the border markets. Ceremonial pieces, mostly. Religious significance but no practical use, we thought." Her expression suggested recent events had challenged that assumption.

Lin extended her magical senses toward the glowing satchel and immediately felt chaotic resonance between whatever was inside and the fragile laylines beneath the Academy. The sensation was unlike anything she'd encountered—not the screaming corruption of damaged magic, but something that felt like music played on a slightly out-of-tune instrument.

"The laylines here have been damaged recently," she explained. "Whatever you're carrying might be responding to the instability. May I see the artifacts?"

Astrid glanced at her companions, who offered nods of agreement. "If you think you can help. But be careful—some of these pieces have been in my clan for centuries. They're irreplaceable."

She opened the satchel with deliberate care, revealing contents that made Lin's breath catch. Carved bone pieces covered with intricate symbols, polished stones with patterns that seemed to shift in the light, and most prominently, a staff made from antler with spiraling grooves filled with dark metal.

The antler staff was singing. Silver light pulsed along its carved channels in rhythm with musical tones that filled the air around them. The pattern reminded Lin of breathing, as if the artifact was somehow alive and responding to their presence.

"These symbols," Lin said, studying the carvings with growing fascination. "They're not decorative. They're functional. They're meant to channel magical energy."

Astrid's expression shifted to surprise. "You can read the old marks? Most southerners see them as primitive decoration."

Before Lin could respond, the antler staff's song suddenly intensified. Its silver glow flared so brightly that onlookers stepped back with startled exclamations. The musical tone shifted higher, becoming almost urgent, and Lin felt something deep in her magical awareness respond with recognition.

The Forest Spirit in her blackthorn staff stirred with sudden alertness, its consciousness touching hers with images of ancient trees, standing stones, and magic that predated all civilized traditions. For one dizzying moment, she felt connected to something vast and old, a tradition of power that had flowed through the world long before anyone built academies or organized guilds.

Her skin tingled as if touched by lightning. The taste of copper flooded her mouth while her vision sharpened until she could see individual threads of silver light dancing between the carved symbols. The magical resonance between the artifacts and the damaged laylines sang through her bones like music made of starlight and storm winds.

"It's trying to communicate," she whispered, her voice barely audible as understanding flooded through her. "These aren't just ceremonial objects. They're tools. They're meant to work with natural magical flow, not against it."

The realization hit her like diving into icy water. Everything she'd learned about magic at the Academy was based on controlling and directing magical energy through careful formulas and precise techniques. But what if there was another way? What if instead of imposing structure on magic, you could work with its natural patterns?

Around them, the crowd pressed closer despite the Guild representatives' attempts to maintain order. Lin could feel their nervous energy mixing with the magical resonance from the artifacts, creating an atmosphere charged with potential like the air before a thunderstorm.

Astrid was watching her with growing interest. "You have the sight," she said, and it wasn't a question. "I wondered if any southern mages would be able to see what they truly are. My grandmother always said the old knowledge would return when the world needed it most."

The antler staff's glow pulsed brighter, its song rising to a crescendo that made the air itself seem to vibrate. Lin felt the Forest Spirit responding, reaching out through her staff toward the ancient artifact with something that felt like recognition between old friends.

"Would you be willing to show me how they work?" Lin asked, her voice steady despite the excitement coursing through her. "I've been experimenting with techniques that might complement your traditions. Perhaps we could learn from each other."

Astrid's weathered face broke into a genuine smile. "Now that," she said, "is exactly what my grandmother would have wanted to hear."
