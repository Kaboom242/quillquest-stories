# Chapter 21: Songs of Memory

Lin woke to the sharp crack of Greta's armor as her friend sat bolt upright in the pre-dawn darkness, breath coming in quick gasps that cut through the grove's morning quiet.

"Easy, Gret," Tobi's voice carried gentle concern from where he was nursing their fire back to life, sparks dancing as dry twigs caught. "Just dreams."

"Were they?" Greta's voice scraped raw with sleepless hours. "Every time I closed my eyes, I heard that phrase. 'Pilot zone for pagan remediation.' How do you call systematic cultural murder a nightmare when it's documented policy?"

Lin reached over to squeeze her friend's gauntleted hand, feeling the desperate grip beneath cold metal. "Because it's still horrible. Policy or nightmare—it's still wrong."

Willi glanced up from organizing their gear, her steady movements contrasting with the exhaustion shadowing all their eyes. "At least now we understand why the Academy was so insistent about 'primitive practices' being unreliable. Can't question authority if you're taught to dismiss contradictory evidence."

"Speaking of evidence," Tobi said, nodding toward Korren approaching through morning mist between the trees, "looks like today's lesson is starting."

The deeper grove felt different the moment they entered it—seven ancient oaks forming a natural amphitheater where Lin's magical senses encountered something that hummed with accumulated power rather than the broken struggle of yesterday's damaged circle.

"Centuries of difference," she murmured, letting her awareness explore energy patterns threading between massive trunks.

"Six centuries," Korren confirmed, settling cross-legged beneath the largest oak with movements that spoke of countless similar mornings. Her weathered hands found bark patterns worn smooth by generations of contact. "Yesterday you witnessed destruction. Today you'll discover why your Church fears memory magic above all traditional practices."

Lin watched Greta's breathing quicken, yesterday's revelations still fresh wounds in her friend's theological understanding.

"Memory magic?" Willi asked, her practical mind already calculating implications. "The Academy insisted preserved memories were too unreliable for historical accuracy. Too much human distortion."

"Convenient story," Tobi snorted, street-smart instincts recognizing manipulation from long experience. "Hard to maintain official narratives when actual evidence contradicts them."

Korren pressed both palms against ancient bark, and the grove's atmosphere thickened around them. Lin felt the air itself holding its breath, weighted with accumulated truth that made her magical senses tingle with anticipation.

"This grove remembers six hundred years of clan gatherings," Korren said. "Not interpretations or summaries, but complete truth of what actually occurred. Every significant word spoken, every decision made, every promise kept or broken."

Lin's stomach dropped as the implications hit. "Six hundred years of unedited records? The political ramifications..."

"Exactly why Church doctrine dismisses memory magic as primitive superstition," Korren replied with grim satisfaction. "Difficult to rewrite history when people can access actual memories of events."

"But how do you verify accuracy?" Greta asked, her strategic training emerging despite spiritual turmoil. "What prevents false memory contamination?"

"The trees themselves." Korren's hands moved across bark with unconscious reverence. "Living wood resonates with truth in ways human consciousness cannot fake. Attempt to preserve deliberate lies, and the grove rejects the recording entirely."

"Natural verification," Lin realized, magical mechanics becoming clear. "The magic itself prevents historical manipulation."

"The Church's worst nightmare," Tobi observed with dark satisfaction. "Truth that can't be controlled, rewritten, or conveniently forgotten."

"Want to hear how 'Peaceful Integration of the Northern Clans' actually sounded?" Korren asked, pressing deeper against the oak's trunk.

The air around them began vibrating as the tree responded. Then voices filled the grove—not echoes but actual preserved conversations carrying all the emotional weight of their original moments.

"...Church representatives assured complete respect for territorial autonomy under voluntary spiritual oversight arrangements..."

Lin's hands clenched involuntarily as formal negotiation cadences reached her ears. These weren't stories—they were the past itself speaking through voices of people who'd believed they were protecting their families.

"...the written contract specifies Church authority to modify traditional practices for 'theological compatibility.' That contradicts their verbal promises..."

"...they're documenting our consent while lying about what we're consenting to..."

The voices faded, leaving grove air heavy with preserved betrayal. Lin watched color drain from Greta's face as systematic deception became undeniable reality.

"When?" The word came out as barely a whisper.

"Forty-three years ago," Korren replied. "Your Church records it as successful voluntary integration. The grove remembers documented fraud."

"Shit," Tobi breathed. "How many other 'voluntary agreements' were pure manipulation?"

"Would you like to hear what Church officials really said when they believed no one was recording?" Korren asked quietly.

Lin felt Greta's grip tighten on her hand, knuckles white beneath armor as her friend wrestled with duty versus dread.

"Show us," Greta said finally, her voice carrying the determined honesty that had earned her knighthood.

New voices filled the air, speaking with casual cruelty that made Lin's throat tighten.

"...these primitive practices will disappear within a generation through systematic elimination. Remove children for 'education,' disrupt traditional cycles, ensure the next generation associates ancestral ways with shame..."

"...regional command requires plausible deniability. Document everything as 'voluntary modernization.' History will remember us as progress facilitators, not civilization destroyers..."

Lin's vision blurred as nausea swept through her. The preserved voices discussed cultural genocide with the same tone as administrative efficiency. She could see matching horror on her friends' faces—recognition that this wasn't rogue behavior but standard policy implementation.

"Stop," Greta choked out, voice fracturing. "Please."

"Hey." Tobi moved closer with practiced gentleness, the kind learned from streets where vulnerability invited predators but offering comfort kept friends alive. "We've got you."

Greta's shoulders shook beneath her armor. "I'm not okay. How can I be? Everything I believed about serving spiritual truth..."

"Is meeting actual reality," Willi finished, her practical directness cutting through emotional fog. "And reality's winning."

Lin shifted to wrap her arm around Greta's armored shoulders, feeling tension like a wire ready to snap. "The Light still guides truth, Gret. Maybe the Church just stopped following where it leads."

"But how do I tell the difference?" Anguish made Greta's voice crack. "If systematic oppression gets presented as divine service, how do I know what I'm actually serving?"

"Same way you always have," Tobi said with street-earned wisdom. "Look at what actions do to people. What did this do to families like Madern's?"

The question hung between them while they processed together, understanding deeper than any individual could reach alone.

"Can you show recent memories?" Lin asked, needing momentum before Greta's crisis overwhelmed them all. "Information about magical disruptions?"

"If preserved here," Korren replied carefully. "What are you seeking?"

"Connections between infrastructure destruction and current failures," Lin said, pressing her palm against ancient bark.

The tree's response struck immediately—not voices but collective fear carried in preserved memory. Recent gatherings where clan elders shared reports of magical failures across territories, desperate discussions about protections no longer functioning, terrified speculation about foundational magic continuing to collapse.

"They understand," she said, pulling back from contact with accumulated worry that made her chest ache. "Traditional practitioners know the disruptions aren't random. Infrastructure destruction is causing systematic breakdown."

"Infrastructure the Church has deliberately eliminated for generations," Korren added with bitter accuracy.

"Wait." Willi's practical mind made connections at characteristic speed. "If they've been destroying magical foundations for decades, and abilities are failing everywhere now..."

"The disasters aren't accidents," Lin realized, pieces clicking together with horrible clarity. "They're consequences of systematic infrastructure destruction."

"Church authorities discussed exactly those possibilities," Korren said quietly. "Officials who understood the risks and chose political control over magical stability."

"Show us," Greta said, determination growing in her voice. "If I'm serving the Light properly, I need to understand what darkness I've been supporting."

The voices that filled the grove spoke with clinical detachment that made Lin's skin crawl.

"...seventeen traditional power sites successfully eliminated in northern territories. Local practices should become impossible within five years..."

"...theological advisors warn destroying foundational infrastructure might destabilize magical systems beyond our control..."

"...political necessity outweighs magical considerations. Traditional practices threaten Church authority. Better to risk instability than permit organized resistance..."

Silence returned, leaving them processing institutional calculation that valued political power over magical stability.

"They knew," Greta said, voice hollow with systematic betrayal. "Church leadership understood destroying traditional infrastructure might cause these disasters, and decided political benefits justified the risks."

"Institutional thinking," Tobi said grimly. "Short-term gains, long-term catastrophe. Someone else's problem when bills come due."

"So what can we do?" Willi asked with practical directness. "Infrastructure's destroyed, knowledge scattered, systems collapsing."

"Not everything's lost," Lin said slowly, understanding crystallizing. "Knowledge is preserved in places like this. Infrastructure can potentially be rebuilt. If traditional practitioners coordinated efforts..."

"To restore what was systematically destroyed," Greta finished, strategic thinking engaging despite spiritual crisis. "Rebuild infrastructure and recover knowledge before collapse becomes irreversible."

"That makes us heretics by Church law," Willi pointed out.

"Then we're heretics," Greta replied with quiet conviction that surprised them all. "Serving the Light means serving truth, not institutional control that destroys truth for power."

"You sure about this?" Tobi asked gently. "Going against the Church isn't exactly safe."

"Neither is watching the world burn while following orders from people who lit the fire," Greta replied, reaching for Lin's hand again. "Some things are worth the risk."

As they prepared to leave, Lin watched Greta kneel before the ancient oak, pressing her palm against bark with reverence for powers older and more trustworthy than institutions she'd served.

When her friend stood, Lin saw fundamental change in her expression. The Knight of the Light remained, but now she served Light that valued truth over institutional control and ancient wisdom over political convenience.

Transformation that would change everything about their journey through the Wild Lands, and everything about what they might do returning to territories where Church law held absolute authority.

The real work was just beginning.
