# Chapter 15: The Haunted Bridge - Draft 2

Lin breathed deeply as her horse crested the final hill before the Silberbach valley, savoring air that tasted properly of summer grass instead of the metallic corruption they'd left behind at Rowan Hollow. Her muscles finally unknotted from the tension of working so close to layline torture, and she let herself appreciate the clean morning light that turned the surrounding farmland into a patchwork of gold and green.

The reprieve lasted exactly until she extended her magical senses toward their destination and felt the tangle waiting ahead—not the screaming agony of corrupted magic, but something that pulled at her chest with the weight of old grief and unfinished business.

"Bridge has been impassable for five days," Willi said, unfolding their contract against her saddle horn with the methodical attention she brought to all their jobs. "Merchants report seeing figures that vanish when approached, and water that speaks in voices of the drowned." Her frown suggested she found the latter claim particularly dubious. "Local garrison tried to clear it twice, but their horses refuse to set hoof on the stones."

Tobi strummed a melody that bounced cheerfully off the hills around them. "Horses have more sense than most soldiers. They can smell death magic from a mile away, unlike humans who require actual corpses before asking uncomfortable questions."

Lin guided her horse down the winding road toward the river, watching the Silberbach's green valley spread below them like a wound cut through the rolling landscape. The bridge should have been visible from here, a graceful span of gray stone connecting the trade routes between north and south. Instead, she saw a structure that made her skin crawl with wrongness even from a distance.

Frost glittered along stone railings that should have been warm from summer sun. Mist rose from the dark water in spirals that had nothing to do with temperature, and pale figures moved back and forth across the span like moths trapped against glass.

"The Light has shown me visions of restless spirits in my prayers," Greta said, her armor creaking as she studied the haunted bridge ahead. "Souls trapped between this world and the next, unable to find peace." Her voice carried the weight of experience with such hauntings. "They often manifest near water, which holds memories longer than stone or earth."

Lin counted seven distinct shapes pacing the bridge's length, their movements visible even at this distance. Something about their desperate repetition made her throat tighten with sympathetic anguish. These weren't the chaotic flailings of corrupted spirits—they moved with purpose, as if searching for something they could never quite reach.

The south approach to the bridge had become an impromptu camp of stranded travelers. Lin dismounted near a weathered merchant whose wagon sat heavy with goods bound for northern markets, his face carrying the exhausted frustration of someone forced to watch the same impossible sight for days on end.

"Started right after the big storm passed through," he told her when she asked about the haunting. "Water rose faster than anyone's seen in living memory, then when it went down, they were there." His pointing finger trembled slightly as he indicated the ghostly figures. "Keep reaching for something in the water, but they can't quite touch it."

Lin approached the bridge itself, feeling the temperature drop with each step toward the stone approach. The chill bit through her summer clothes like winter wind, and her breath began coming out in visible puffs despite the afternoon sun warming her back. The laylines beneath the ancient stones felt tangled but not corrupted—twisted into knots that spoke of sudden violence and desperate urgency rather than the deliberate torture she'd felt at Rowan Hollow.

When she extended her consciousness toward the magical disturbance, images flashed through her mind: dark water rushing higher than it ever should, desperate voices calling over the roar of flash flood, reaching hands that couldn't quite span the distance to something precious being swept away.

"There was a tragedy here," she said, the certainty settling cold in her chest. "Something sudden that left them unable to move on. But they're not feeding on the laylines—they're just stuck, trapped by something they couldn't finish."

Tobi's lute sang a soft, questioning melody, and Lin watched one of the ghostly figures pause in its endless pacing to turn toward the sound. For a heartbeat, features resolved from pale mist—a young woman's face marked with desperate longing and unbearable sadness.

"Music draws them," Lin realized, her voice barely above a whisper. "They're still connected somehow. That's why they can't pass on—something's anchoring them here."

As afternoon wore toward evening, the spirits became more solid, their movements more frantic. Lin could now make out details of their clothing—travel cloaks, sturdy boots, the practical garments of people caught by disaster while journeying. A ghostly man in a leather coat repeatedly examined something in his translucent hands, his face twisted with anguish.

The breakthrough came as true dusk approached and the temperature around the bridge plummeted until ice began forming on the stone railings. Lin pressed close enough to catch fragments of voices, faint as whispers carried on wind:

"—find the rope, find the rope—"
"—too deep, can't reach—"  
"—baby's crying, where's the baby—"

Understanding hit Lin like a physical blow, stealing her breath and sending ice through her veins. "They're not the ones who died," she whispered, horror and pity warring in her chest. "They're the ones who lived. They're trying to save someone who's still down there."

She pointed toward the water beneath the bridge's central arch, where current ran deepest and swiftest around hidden obstacles. "There's someone in the river. Someone they couldn't save, and they're trapped here trying to finish the rescue."

Greta strode toward the bridge with purpose that made her armor ring like bells. "Then we finish what they started," she declared. "No soul should be lost when help is possible, whether they draw breath or not."

But as Lin stepped onto the frost-slicked stones, the ghostly figures turned toward her with expressions of wild hope and terror. Seven souls reached out with translucent hands, their desperate need pressing against her consciousness like a physical weight. The question burning in her mind was whether she could give them the closure they craved, or if she was about to become the eighth spirit trapped on the haunted Silberbach bridge.

The water beneath the span ran dark and swift, keeping whatever secrets it held in the depths where seven living people had once reached in vain, and where their spirits still searched with the desperate persistence of love that refused to accept defeat.
