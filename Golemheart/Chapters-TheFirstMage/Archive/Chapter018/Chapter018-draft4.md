# Chapter 018 Draft 4: Into the Wild Lands

The runestones hummed beside Lin's chair like restless insects, their wrapped forms pulsing with soft light that seemed to respond to her heartbeat. Three days had passed since the travel-worn adventurers had deposited the artifacts in their care, and the decision of what to do next hung over their comfortable domestic routine like storm clouds gathering on a clear horizon.

"We need to decide," Lin said, breaking the morning silence that had stretched too long over their shared breakfast. Steam rose from her untouched porridge while autumn light streamed through diamond-paned windows, illuminating dust motes that danced like tiny spirits in the air.

Greta set down her spoon with characteristic precision, her systematic mind already organizing the implications they'd been avoiding. "The Academy representatives will expect a report within the week. Standard procedure for artifacts of unknown provenance."

"Standard procedure that ends with these stones locked in a vault while bureaucrats debate jurisdiction for months," Tobi observed from his perch near the fireplace, fingers absently plucking discord from his lute strings. "Meanwhile, whatever they're trying to tell us gets buried under institutional protocol."

Willi emerged from the kitchen alcove, flour dusting her brown dress and practical concern etched across her features. "The bigger question is whether we can afford to keep them. Every day they grow more active, more noticeable. How long before someone reports strange lights and humming sounds to the authorities?"

Lin felt the truth of that concern settle in her chest like cold stone. Their rented house sat wedged between a clockmaker's shop and a textile merchant, surrounded by neighbors whose livelihoods depended on maintaining good relationships with guild representatives and Church officials. Harboring potentially dangerous magical artifacts violated half a dozen local ordinances.

"So we surrender them to Academy custody," Greta said, though her voice carried no conviction. "Follow proper channels, ensure they receive appropriate scholarly attention, and avoid legal complications that could destroy our reputations."

"Appropriate scholarly attention," Lin repeated, tasting the bitter irony. "You mean they'll assign some junior researcher to catalogue their physical properties while the real mysteries remain locked away from anyone with genuine curiosity about their function."

She stood and moved to the wrapped bundle, feeling the harmonic resonance intensify as she approached. The sensation reminded her powerfully of standing near active laylines during the Grenzfeld crisis—that feeling of vast power flowing just beneath the surface of ordinary reality, waiting for someone with proper knowledge to channel it safely.

"The layline frequencies," she continued, her voice growing stronger with conviction. "These stones are tuned to resonances that Academy training doesn't recognize. If they represent some lost understanding of magical theory, surrendering them to institutional custody guarantees that knowledge stays lost."

Tobi's lute fell silent as he focused complete attention on the conversation that would determine their immediate future. "And if we keep them? What exactly are you proposing, Lin?"

The question hung in the air like incense, heavy with implications none of them could ignore. Lin realized she'd been circling around the answer for days, afraid to voice what her researcher's instincts already knew with crystalline certainty.

"We take them north," she said simply. "To the clan territories where they originated. We learn what they represent, document everything properly, and ensure this knowledge survives instead of vanishing into Academy bureaucracy."

"North," Greta repeated with the careful neutrality that meant she was calculating risks and consequences with diplomatic precision. "Into territories where Imperial authority weakens and local customs take precedence over institutional oversight."

"Into territories where people might actually remember what these stones were designed to accomplish," Lin countered. "The adventurers mentioned collecting them from abandoned clan sites. If anyone understands their original function, it would be the communities that created them."

Willi crossed her arms, her practical engineering mind immediately engaging with logistical realities. "Northern travel in late autumn means serious weather risks. We'd need cold-weather gear, preserved food supplies, camping equipment designed for survival rather than comfort. Not to mention reliable maps through territories where road conditions become... variable."

"Variable," Tobi said with growing enthusiasm that suggested he was already imagining the adventure. "That's an interesting way to describe regions where bandits outnumber merchants and clan disputes can turn peaceful valleys into war zones overnight."

"The dangers are real," Greta acknowledged, pen already moving across ledger pages as she began systematic documentation of their options. "But there are also protocols we could establish. Documentation procedures that preserve our findings regardless of personal outcomes. Emergency procedures if we encounter situations beyond our capabilities."

Lin watched her friends processing the implications, each bringing their natural perspective to a decision that would transform their comfortable academic life into something far more dangerous and uncertain. But she also saw something else in their expressions—curiosity warring with caution, excitement fighting prudence, the scholar's hunger for discovery competing with practical survival instincts.

"There's another consideration," she said quietly, feeling the runestones pulse with increasing urgency as if responding to her words. "The Academy representatives have been 'difficult to locate' according to the adventurers. That suggests institutional priorities have shifted toward other concerns. If we surrender these artifacts to an Academy that's already distracted by political crisis, what guarantee do we have they'll receive proper attention?"

"None whatsoever," Tobi replied with characteristic bluntness. "More likely they'll sit in storage while administrators debate whether studying them falls under magical theory, historical research, or potential security threats."

Greta's pen paused above her ledger as she considered implications that extended beyond their immediate decision. "You're suggesting the current political instability makes Academy custody less secure rather than more reliable."

"I'm suggesting," Lin said, moving closer to her friends so they could feel the artifacts' harmonic resonance more clearly, "that we have an opportunity to preserve knowledge that might otherwise be lost to institutional neglect or deliberate suppression."

The morning light shifted as clouds began gathering outside their windows, and Lin realized they'd been unconsciously leaning closer together, drawn by shared recognition that their decision would determine whether ancient knowledge survived or vanished forever.

"What if we're wrong?" Greta asked with the methodical honesty that made her such a valuable voice in difficult decisions. "What if these stones represent something genuinely dangerous rather than merely misunderstood? Taking them to isolated territories where oversight is minimal could endanger innocent communities."

"What if we're right?" Lin countered, feeling the harmonic resonance pulse through her bones with increasing intensity. "What if they hold keys to understanding layline instability, and surrendering them to Academy storage means losing the only chance to prevent future magical disasters?"

Tobi set aside his lute completely, his expression growing serious as moral implications crystallized around their choice. "The question isn't whether we're taking risks. The question is whether we're taking the right risks for the right reasons."

"And what are the right reasons?" Willi asked with characteristic directness that cut through philosophical abstraction to practical reality.

"Preservation of knowledge versus institutional control," Lin said, her voice growing stronger with conviction. "Discovery versus bureaucratic safety. Trusting clan communities to share wisdom versus assuming Imperial institutions know better."

"Put that way," Tobi said with a grin that suggested his decision was already crystallizing, "I prefer discovery and community wisdom over bureaucratic control and institutional assumptions."

"Even if it means abandoning our comfortable life here for uncertain survival in hostile territories?" Greta pressed, her systematic mind still calculating potential costs against hoped-for benefits.

"Especially then," Lin replied, surprising herself with the certainty in her voice. "Comfort that requires abandoning our principles isn't comfort worth preserving."

She moved to the wrapped artifacts, feeling their harmonic resonance intensify as her proximity increased. The sensation reminded her of tuning forks vibrating in sympathetic harmony, as if the stones were responding to her commitment with approval and anticipation.

"If we choose this path," Willi said slowly, her practical mind already shifting from debate to implementation, "we need to be systematic about preparation. Food preservation, weather protection, documentation materials, emergency supplies for surviving in territories where we can't rely on friendly innkeepers."

"And diplomatic protocols," Greta added, her training automatically engaging with cross-cultural communication challenges. "Clan societies operate according to customs that differ significantly from Imperial norms. We'll need to understand proper etiquette for approaching elders, requesting instruction, and demonstrating respect for traditional knowledge."

"Most importantly," Tobi observed with growing enthusiasm, "we'll need to approach them as students rather than experts. Clan communities have preserved knowledge through oral tradition for generations. They'll respond better to humility than academic credentials."

Lin felt something fundamental shift in the room's atmosphere as her friends moved from questioning their decision to planning its successful implementation. The runestones' humming intensified, their light brightening until the silk wrapping could no longer fully contain the radiance.

"We're actually committed to this," she said, wonder coloring her voice as the implications settled around them. "We're choosing to abandon security and comfort in pursuit of knowledge that might not even exist."

"Or might revolutionize magical understanding," Greta corrected with diplomatic precision. "The uncertainty cuts both ways. But I agree with your assessment of institutional alternatives. Academy custody offers guaranteed mediocrity while clan instruction offers potential breakthrough discovery."

"Plus," Tobi added with characteristic optimism, "adventure beats routine even when routine is comfortable. We've been establishing ourselves in Eisenstadt for months, but have we been truly living or merely existing safely?"

"Safely," Willi admitted with rueful honesty. "My engineering skills haven't been challenged since we arrived. I've been baking bread and organizing supplies rather than solving problems that require innovation."

"And I've been documenting market transactions instead of exploring cross-cultural diplomatic protocols," Greta observed. "Comfortable but professionally stagnant."

"While I've been teaching basic alchemy to apprentices who don't want to learn rather than pursuing research that excites my curiosity," Lin added, feeling the truth of that statement resonate with the artifacts' harmonic frequency.

They sat in companionable silence for several moments, each processing the recognition that their comfortable domestic routine had become a cage that limited their growth rather than supporting it. The runestones pulsed beside them with increasing urgency, as if sensing their readiness to embrace uncertainty in pursuit of discovery.

"Three days for preparation," Willi said decisively, her practical nature already organizing logistics. "Time to acquire cold-weather gear, preserve travel food, arrange storage for possessions we can't carry, and establish communication protocols with trusted contacts."

"And time to research clan customs through local sources," Greta added, her systematic approach immediately engaging with cultural preparation requirements. "Border merchants, traveling storytellers, anyone who has regular contact with northern communities."

"Time to compose traveling songs that demonstrate respect for oral tradition," Tobi contributed with artistic enthusiasm. "Music often opens doors that academic credentials cannot."

"Time to study these runestones more carefully before we encounter their creators," Lin said, moving to unwrap the artifacts completely for the first time since accepting custody.

As the silk fell away, harmonic resonance filled their shared space with complex frequencies that seemed to speak directly to magical awareness rather than physical hearing. The carved stones glowed with soft light that illuminated intricate patterns cut deep into their surfaces—not decorative designs but functional symbols that conveyed meaning Lin could almost but not quite grasp.

"They're beautiful," Greta breathed, her systematic mind immediately beginning to document pattern details in precise sketches.

"They're responding to our commitment," Lin observed, feeling the resonance shift and intensify as if the artifacts approved of their decision to seek proper instruction rather than surrender to institutional custody.

"They're trying to communicate," Tobi said with wonder, his musician's ear detecting harmonic complexities that spoke of intelligence rather than random activation.

"They're teaching us that we made the right choice," Willi concluded with characteristic practicality that cut through mystical speculation to emotional truth.

As if summoned by their commitment, urgent knocking shattered the domestic planning session. Not the polite rap of neighbors or the measured knock of official business, but desperate hammering that spoke of genuine crisis requiring immediate attention.

Lin felt the runestones pulse with sudden tension, their harmonic humming shifting to a frequency that made her teeth ache with resonance. Whatever approached their door, the artifacts recognized it as significant to their newly crystallized mission.

"I'll answer," Greta said, her bearing automatically shifting from careful planner to authoritative knight. "The rest of you secure anything that shouldn't be visible to unexpected visitors."

But before she could reach the door, it burst open to reveal a mud-splattered messenger whose expression carried news that made Lin's stomach clench with dread even before he spoke.

"Church investigators," he gasped, exhaustion and terror making his voice shake. "Moving through the border settlements. Questioning travelers about traditional artifacts and forbidden research. They're burning books, confiscating anything that looks remotely like pre-Academy magical theory."

The words hit their planning session like lightning striking dry timber. Lin watched her friends' faces transform from hopeful preparation to grim recognition that their comfortable debate had just become urgent necessity for survival.

"How much time do we have?" Tobi asked with practical directness that had replaced his earlier enthusiasm.

"Hours, maybe less," the messenger replied, swaying with fatigue that spoke of desperate travel. "They're working systematically through every settlement, every inn, every place where scholars or researchers might seek shelter."

Willi was already moving toward their supplies with characteristic efficiency. "Change of plans. We leave immediately, with whatever we can carry quickly. Academic preparation becomes survival necessity."

"The main roads?" Greta asked, her systematic mind immediately adapting to crisis circumstances.

"Blocked by investigators," the messenger confirmed. "But the old shepherd paths through the eastern forest might still be clear. Dangerous in this weather, but less dangerous than Church custody for anyone carrying artifacts they consider heretical."

Lin felt the runestones pulse with increasing urgency as she wrapped them securely for travel. Their comfortable decision-making process had become desperate flight, their academic mission transformed into preservation of knowledge that institutional authorities apparently considered dangerous enough to destroy.

"We go," she said, surprising herself with the determination in her voice. "Not because we planned properly, but because waiting means losing everything we hoped to preserve."

As they grabbed essential supplies and abandoned their comfortable domestic life, Lin realized their northern journey had begun not with careful preparation but with the recognition that some knowledge was worth risking everything to protect from systematic destruction.

The runestones sang beside her with harmonic urgency that seemed to acknowledge the stakes, and somehow she knew their artifacts had been waiting for exactly this moment when institutional pressure would force them to choose between safety and preservation of ancient wisdom that predated all modern magical theory.

Outside their windows, autumn rain began falling like tears for everything they were leaving behind in pursuit of mysteries that might hold keys to understanding magic itself.

Within an hour, they were walking north through forest paths that would lead them toward clan territories where oral tradition preserved knowledge the Empire apparently feared enough to systematically destroy. Their comfortable academic life had ended, but their real education was just beginning.
