# Chapter 14: Evernight at Rowan Hollow - Draft 1

The road to Rowan Hollow stretched before them like a ribbon through amber twilight that refused to give way to dawn. Lin pressed her palm against her blackthorn staff as they rode, feeling the Forest Spirit within shift uneasily. The wrongness in the air tasted of copper and stale breath, as if the world itself had been holding its lungs closed for too long.

"Time's broken here," she murmured, watching her shadow fall in the same direction it had for the past three hours. The sun hung motionless in a sky the color of old honey, neither rising nor setting.

Tobi stretched in his saddle, lute catching the strange amber light. "Well, ladies, looks like we're stuck in the world's most ominous painting. At least the lighting makes you all look absolutely radiant." He winked at Greta, who rolled her eyes with practiced efficiency.

"Your priorities remain as twisted as this corrupted landscape," Greta said, though Lin caught the hint of a smile tugging at her lips. "We should focus on the villagers trapped in this temporal prison."

The village of Rowan Hollow sprawled below them as they crested the final hill, and Lin's heart clenched at the sight. People moved through their daily routines with mechanical precision, each gesture identical to the last. She watched a baker carry the same tray of bread past the same window every three minutes and forty-seven seconds, his face growing more vacant with each repetition.

"Fresh bread! Finest in the valley!" he called to no one in particular, his voice echoing hollowly.

Willi dismounted and pulled dried meat from her pack, offering strips to each of them. "Eat something before we go down there. Whatever's causing this has been feeding on the laylines for weeks. We'll need our strength."

Lin extended her magical senses toward the village, then immediately cried out and clutched her head as agony shot through her skull. The laylines beneath Rowan Hollow writhed like wounded animals, twisted into knots that pulsed with sick red light. Each pulse felt like a scream of pain transmitted directly into her bones.

"The laylines aren't just damaged," she gasped, pressing her free hand to her temple. "They're being tortured. Something's feeding on them deliberately, knotting them up to increase the pain."

They spent the next hour mapping the temporal boundaries with grim efficiency. Some villagers repeated three-minute cycles, others twelve-minute loops. An elderly woman swept the same patch of doorstep endlessly, her movements becoming more mechanical with each repetition. When Willi tried to speak with her, the woman's eyes looked through them as if they were ghosts.

"Harvest day, dear," the woman said in a voice like an echo of an echo. "Always harvest day in Rowan Hollow. Been blessed with such fine weather, praise the Light." She returned to sweeping, each stroke covering the exact same stones.

A low humming drifted across the village, barely audible but persistent, like a chord played on broken strings. Lin felt it in her teeth, in the hollow of her bones. The sound grew stronger when she looked toward the ancient forest that bordered the village's northern edge.

"There," she said, pointing toward the treeline. "Whatever's doing this is in the forest. All the corruption flows that direction."

As they approached the forest entrance, dozens of spirits clustered around the treeline. But these weren't the friendly woodland sprites Lin expected. These spirits were panicked, blocking the forest paths with their small bodies and chittering warnings in voices like breaking glass.

"Turn back! Turn back!" squeaked a tuckling, its bark-skin mottled with stress patterns. "Great hunger wakes! Old promises break! No passage for warm-bloods!"

More spirits emerged—rootlings that normally tended forest growth now twisted their branches into barrier patterns, and shadow-wisps darted between the trees like warning flags. They weren't hostile, Lin realized. They were terrified.

"They're trying to protect us from something," she said softly. "Something that's traumatized the entire forest."

Willi knelt among the spirits and began humming a gentle lullaby, her voice carrying the warmth of hearthside comfort. The melody seemed to ease some of their panic, their chittering becoming less frantic.

Greta stepped forward with solemn dignity. "By the Light that guides all souls," she said formally, "we swear we come not as conquerors but as healers. We seek to mend what has been broken."

Tobi sat on a fallen log and pulled out his lute, his usual mischievous grin replaced by quiet focus. "Hey, little ones," he said gently, beginning to play a soft melody that complemented Willi's humming. "Sometimes broken things can be fixed, if someone cares enough to try."

Lin stepped forward slowly, keeping her movements peaceful. "I can see how much pain you're all in," she said to the spirits. "The laylines are screaming, aren't they? We want to help. We want to make the screaming stop."

The spirits wavered between panic and desperate hope. A brave rootling approached Lin's outstretched hand, touching her finger with one tiny branch. The contact let her feel their terror—fear so deep it had become part of the forest's heartwood, and underneath that, terrible grief for something ancient and beloved that had been twisted beyond recognition.

"You're trying to protect us from something you love," Lin breathed, tears stinging her eyes. "Something that's been corrupted into something terrible."

The spirits clustered together, communicating in whispers too fast for human ears. Finally, the brave rootling spoke: "Warm-bloods may pass. But beware—great tree grieves beyond healing. Ancient hunger grows beyond stopping. Old friend becomes old enemy."

The wall of spirits parted reluctantly, creating a narrow path between the trees. As they stepped across the threshold, Lin felt the temperature drop and shadows move independently of any light source. The wrongness pressed against her lungs like a physical weight.

"This place feels wrong," Greta muttered, one hand drifting to her sword hilt. "The darkness here isn't natural."

Lin realized their torches would be useless against the supernatural shadow pressing in around them. "I need to make something new," she said, the solution crystallizing from half-remembered lessons. "A Spirit-lantern that can see through corruption like this."

The work was delicate and draining. Lin settled cross-legged on the forest floor and pulled out silk thread that shimmered with its own faint luminescence, a small crystal from Tobi's collection, and her grandmother's etching stylus. Each spirit-thread had to be woven in precise patterns, creating pathways for spiritual energy to flow without interference.

"Little spirits," she whispered as she worked, keeping her voice gentle. "I need a partner—someone brave enough to help guide us through this corruption."

A tiny spark of light drifted down from the branches above, pulsing with nervous energy but also curiosity. Lin held perfectly still as it circled the crystal, investigating her work with careful attention.

"Hello there," she said softly. "We're partners in this. You can leave anytime. We're just asking for your help to see clearly in dark places."

The spirit settled onto the crystal with a sound like tiny wind chimes. When the weaving was complete, Lin cupped the finished lantern in both hands and took a steadying breath.

"This is going to cost me," she warned her friends. "Hearthflame isn't meant to be given away lightly."

She opened her inner flame with careful deliberation, feeling the warm golden energy that lived at her core. Then, with an act of will that felt like tearing off a piece of her soul, she breathed pure Hearthflame into the crystal. The world immediately felt colder and more distant, colors draining from her vision as exhaustion hit like a physical blow. She swayed and would have fallen if Willi hadn't caught her shoulders.

The Spirit-lantern blazed to life with soft, steady radiance that seemed to warm the air around them. The little spirit inside chimed contentedly, its fear transforming into determination.

"Thank you," Lin whispered to her ethereal partner, hanging the lantern from her staff with trembling hands. "Now let's see what we're really dealing with."

The lantern's light revealed a transformed landscape. Laylines became visible as ribbons of sickly red energy, all flowing toward the forest's heart like blood drawn toward an open wound. Small spirits clustered around the trees—not healthy woodland sprites, but creatures driven to distraction by pain they couldn't escape. Most disturbing of all, she could see the corruption itself: dark veins running through everything, pulsing with hungry malevolence.

"Something's feeding," she said, her voice barely above a whisper. "Not just consuming the laylines, but actively twisting them. Making them hurt on purpose."

As they ventured deeper into the forest, the Spirit-lantern attracted attention from local spirits who emerged from hiding with desperate hope. Tucklings with faces like carved wood but eyes full of too-human pain gathered around them. Shadow-wisps flickered between visibility, too hurt to maintain solid form but drawn to the healing light.

"The path winds true but danger grows," the spirit in the lantern chimed, its voice like silver bells touched with sadness. "Ancient friend sleeps in pain, dreams in hunger. We guide where feet may walk, but hearts must be strong for what waits ahead."

They followed the winding path deeper into the haunted woods, the Spirit-lantern their only reliable guide through the shifting maze of corrupted trees. The supernatural darkness seemed to thicken around them, pressing in from all sides like a living thing.

Finally, they emerged into a clearing where a single massive Rowan tree stood at the center, its trunk easily sixty feet around and its canopy lost in the supernatural gloom above. But this wasn't the healthy guardian tree it should have been. Dark veins pulsed through its bark, and the very air around it hummed with the same painful frequency that had echoed through the village.

"There," Lin breathed, feeling the Spirit-lantern's light waver as they approached. "That's what's been feeding on the laylines. But it used to be something beautiful, didn't it?"

The tree's presence filled the clearing with an aura of ancient grief and corrupted hunger, waiting for them to draw closer to whatever tragedy had transformed a forest guardian into a source of temporal torment.
