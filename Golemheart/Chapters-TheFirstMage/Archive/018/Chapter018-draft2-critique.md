**RATING: 8/10 - NEEDS MINOR REVISION**

This draft shows dramatic improvement in all critical areas. The outline beats are thoroughly covered, character dynamics are excellent, and the wilderness survival demonstration provides both practical plot advancement and effective comedy. Tobi's moral leadership emergence is powerfully executed, and Willi's confidence-building through essential skills is perfectly handled.

The POV consistency is much improved, though a few analytical observations could be better anchored to Lin's perspective. Pacing allows proper development of key scenes, and the specific persecution examples create visceral understanding of institutional oppression.

**Minor areas for final polish**: Reduce remaining exposition, smooth a few transitions, and enhance emotional impact of the Hendricks massacre revelation. The chapter serves the arc theme excellently and provides strong setup for northern journey.

**CONTINUE REVISION PROCESS - One more draft needed for 9/10 standard**
