Lin wiped soot from her cheek and stared at the scorch marks decorating the Eisenstadt market square's cobblestones. The apprentice mages scattered like startled pigeons, clutching their singed robes and muttering about "experimental methods gone wrong." A merchant's cart of autumn turnips bore witness to her latest teaching disaster—half the vegetables now resembled charcoal sculptures.

"Perhaps," said Master Wilhelm, brushing ash from his gray beard, "we might return to traditional brewing methods for the remainder of today's lesson?"

Lin forced a smile that felt more like a grimace. "Of course. Standard formulations. No innovations whatsoever."

The market buzzed with whispered conversations and poorly concealed laughter. She caught fragments—"that foreign girl," "explosive potions," "Academy should never have certified her." Each word stung worse than the minor burns dotting her arms. Three months of teaching basic alchemy in Eisenstadt, and she'd managed to turn herself into the market's most entertaining disaster.

As the last apprentice fled with his intact eyebrows, Lin gathered her scattered notes and wondered if grandmother's stories about patient cultivation had mentioned anything about professional humiliation. The late autumn air carried wood smoke and fresh bread from nearby shops, but all she could smell was her own failure burning in sulfurous clouds.

Greta appeared beside her, armor clanking softly against the cobblestones. "The Light teaches that wisdom comes through trial, not just success."

"Easy for you to say," Lin muttered, stuffing papers into her satchel. "You don't spontaneously combust when demonstrating basic techniques."

"True. I merely lecture people about proper form until they fall asleep." Greta picked up a fallen vial, examining the residue coating its interior. "Though I confess, your results are certainly memorable."

The walk home took them through narrow streets lined with half-timbered houses, their diamond-paned windows glowing amber in the afternoon light. Lin's shoulders gradually unknotted as familiar domestic scents replaced the market's chaos—Willi's cooking, the lingering fragrance of dried herbs, and the comforting mustiness of old books.

Their rented house sat tucked between a clockmaker's shop and a textile merchant, its ground floor dominated by a large hearth that Willi had claimed as her domain. Steam rose from various pots, filling the air with savory promise that made Lin's stomach growl despite her wounded pride.

"How many explosions today?" Tobi called from his perch near the fireplace, not bothering to look up from tuning his lute.

"Only three," Lin replied, dropping her satchel near the door. "I'm improving."

"She's being modest," Greta said, hanging her sword belt on its designated hook. "The final demonstration cleared half the square."

Willi emerged from the kitchen alcove, wooden spoon in hand. "At least you didn't set anyone actually on fire this time. I call that progress." She gestured toward the hearth. "Sit. Food helps everything."

Lin sank into the cushioned chair closest to the fire, letting warmth seep into her bones. This felt right—the four of them in their shared space, teasing and comfortable and real. Not like the stilted formality of Academy classrooms or the hushed reverence of Church sanctuaries. Just friends being friends.

"The merchant guild representative mentioned they might not renew our teaching contract," she admitted, staring into the flames.

"Their loss," Tobi said, setting his lute aside. "Though perhaps we could market your explosions as entertainment. 'Come see the foreign witch detonate vegetables for copper pieces.'"

"Tobi," Greta warned, but her tone carried more amusement than reproach.

"What? I'm being supportive in my own way."

Willi handed Lin a steaming mug that smelled of mulled cider and autumn spices. "Drink. And stop wallowing. You've been pushing yourself too hard trying to make traditional methods work when your magic clearly wants to do something different."

Lin wrapped her hands around the warm ceramic, grateful for the practical comfort. Willi always knew exactly what people needed—food, rest, honest observation delivered without judgment. "Maybe I should just accept that I'm better suited for research than teaching."

"Or maybe," Greta said carefully, settling into her own chair, "you should consider why your methods keep... expanding beyond their intended parameters."

The firelight caught the thoughtful expression on Greta's face, highlighting the gentle concern that always lurked beneath her knightly composure. Lin had learned to read those subtle shifts—Greta trying to offer guidance without overstepping, weighing duty against friendship.

"It's not intentional," Lin protested. "I follow the formulations exactly. Add the prescribed ingredients in the proper sequence. But then something feels wrong, like the magic wants to go somewhere else, and—"

"Boom," Tobi finished cheerfully. "Spectacular, aromatic boom."

"It's almost as if," Greta continued, ignoring Tobi's commentary, "your magical nature conflicts with traditional approaches. Perhaps attempting to force conformity creates... instability."

Before Lin could respond, urgent knocking echoed from their front door. Not the polite rap of neighbors or the measured knock of official business, but the desperate hammering of someone with genuine need.

Willi set down her spoon and moved toward the door, practical instincts already assessing potential problems. Greta's hand drifted toward her sword—not drawing, but ready.

The door opened to reveal a travel-stained party of four adventurers, their gear marking them as seasoned professionals rather than amateur fortune-seekers. The leader, a weathered woman with intricate braids, clutched a leather satchel against her chest.

"We need magical consultation," she announced without preamble. "Guild registry says you're certified practitioners."

Greta rose smoothly, her bearing shifting from relaxed friend to authoritative knight. "What manner of consultation? And what brings you to seek aid at this hour?"

"We've been traveling south from the northern territories," the woman replied, exhaustion evident in every line of her posture. "Carrying artifacts for Academy evaluation. But something's gone wrong."

She opened the satchel carefully, revealing carved stones wrapped in silk cloth. Even through the fabric, Lin felt something responding—a resonance that seemed to tug at the edges of her awareness like a half-remembered melody.

"They were dormant when we collected them," the woman continued. "Just ceremonial pieces from abandoned clan sites. But three days ago, they started... singing."

As if summoned by her words, a low harmonic hum filled the room. The wrapped stones pulsed with soft light, their carved surfaces visible through the silk like lanterns underwater. The sound seemed to sink into Lin's bones, creating sympathetic vibrations that made her teeth ache.

"By the Light," Greta breathed, her usual composure cracking slightly. "What manner of power do these carry?"

Lin stood slowly, drawn by instincts she couldn't name. The resonance felt familiar somehow, like an echo of something she'd always known but never heard clearly. Her experimental magical disasters suddenly made perfect sense—this was what her magic had been reaching toward, this harmonic complexity that traditional methods couldn't contain.

"May I?" she asked, extending her hand toward the satchel.

The lead adventurer hesitated. "Guild mage in Nordmark said they might be dangerous. Recommended immediate Academy containment."

"All the more reason for proper examination," Greta said diplomatically. "We're Academy-certified. Any findings would be reported through proper channels."

Tobi leaned forward with interest. "Though I have to ask—why bring possibly dangerous artifacts to a residential area instead of directly to Academy representatives?"

The woman's expression tightened. "Because Academy representatives have been... difficult to locate. And these stones have been getting more active with each passing day."

Willi crossed her arms. "Define 'more active.'"

"The humming was barely audible three days ago. Yesterday, they started glowing. This morning, our cart horses refused to approach them." She gestured toward the window. "And we had to leave our transportation two streets away because they began rearing and shying."

Lin felt the resonance intensify, as if the stones were responding to proximity or attention. The sensation reminded her of standing near a layline during the Grenzfeld crisis—that feeling of vast power flowing just beneath the surface of ordinary reality.

"The laylines have been unstable since the disasters," Greta observed. "Perhaps these artifacts are responding to the disruption."

"Or causing it," the woman replied grimly. "We need to know which."

Lin stepped closer, her magical awareness stretching toward the wrapped stones. The harmonic vibration seemed to match the frequency of the damaged laylines she'd studied, but with additional complexity—layers of resonance that traditional Academy training hadn't prepared her to understand.

"I think," she said carefully, "these aren't just responding to layline disruption. They're designed to work with laylines. The patterns carved into the stone—they're not decorative."

She looked up at her friends, seeing understanding dawn in their expressions. This wasn't just another magical curiosity requiring routine evaluation. This was the beginning of something larger, more dangerous, and more important than anything they'd encountered.

The stones pulsed brighter, their harmonic song growing stronger, and Lin realized her comfortable domestic life had just ended. Whatever these artifacts represented, they demanded investigation. And investigation would require traveling to their source—the northern territories where traditional knowledge still survived, where Academy authority grew thin, and where answers waited among the ancient stones.

"We'll need to examine them properly," she heard herself saying. "Document their properties. Understand their purpose."

Greta nodded slowly. "And ensure they don't pose a threat to the region."

"Or help with the layline crisis," Willi added practically. "If they're connected."

Tobi grinned, his eyes bright with anticipation. "Sounds like we're about to have another adventure."

The lead adventurer looked between them with visible relief. "Then you'll take responsibility for evaluation?"

Lin glanced at her friends—Greta's dutiful concern, Willi's practical assessment, Tobi's eager curiosity. They'd follow her lead, trust her judgment, support whatever decision she made. The weight of that trust felt heavier than the magical resonance filling their home.

"Yes," she said. "We'll take responsibility."

As the words left her mouth, the stones sang louder, their light brightening until silk could no longer contain it. Whatever she'd just committed them to, the artifacts approved. And somehow, that felt more ominous than reassuring.
