**RATING: 9/10 - EXCELLENT QUALITY ACHIEVED**

This draft successfully addresses all critical issues from previous versions. The clandestine research notes discovery creates natural conflict between Lin and Greta, establishing the ethical tensions that will drive character development. Tobi's theatrical imitation scene provides perfect comedy relief while revealing character dynamics. The cozy conversation about fears and futures adds emotional depth and intimacy. Most importantly, the four-way artifact analysis demonstrates how each character's unique perspective contributes to problem-solving, setting up the group dynamic that will carry the arc.

The chapter now serves the arc theme effectively, establishing ancient knowledge challenging modern Academy control through both Lin's research conflicts and the artifact discovery. Pacing flows naturally from domestic failure through friendship dynamics to world-changing discovery. Character voices are distinct and authentic, with natural dialogue that reveals personality through situation rather than exposition.

**QUALITY STANDARD ACHIEVED - READY FOR FINAL POLISH**
