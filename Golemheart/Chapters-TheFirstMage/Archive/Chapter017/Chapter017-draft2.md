The copper pot bubbled innocently until Lin added the silverwort extract. Then it erupted.

Lin dove sideways as green flame geysered toward the market square's canvas awnings. The apprentice mages scattered, robes singed and dignity abandoned. Master Wilhelm shouted something about proper measurements, but his words vanished in the sulfurous roar of Lin's latest teaching disaster.

When the smoke cleared, Lin found herself sprawled beside a merchant's turnip cart, half the vegetables now resembling charcoal sculptures. Soot decorated her cheek like war paint, and the acrid taste of failed alchemy coated her tongue.

"Perhaps," Master Wilhelm said through gritted teeth, ash settling on his gray beard like early snow, "we might return to traditional brewing methods for the remainder of today's lesson?"

Lin pushed herself upright, brushing cinders from her robes. The gathered apprentices stared with expressions ranging from awe to terror. Three months of teaching basic alchemy in Eisenstadt, and she'd transformed herself into the market's most spectacular failure.

"Of course," she managed, forcing a smile that felt brittle as frost. "Standard formulations. No innovations whatsoever."

The whispers started immediately. "Foreign methods," someone muttered. "Uncontrolled technique." "Should never have been permitted to teach."

Each comment hit like a physical blow. Lin gathered her scattered notes and tried to ignore the way her hands trembled. The market's familiar autumn scents—roasted chestnuts, fresh bread, wood smoke from nearby hearths—couldn't mask the sulfur stinging her nostrils.

As the last apprentice fled with his eyebrows intact, Greta appeared at Lin's elbow. Afternoon sunlight caught the polished mail beneath her surcoat, and her presence radiated the calm authority that made even market chaos settle into order.

"The Light teaches that wisdom emerges through trial as much as success," Greta said diplomatically.

"Easy words when you don't spontaneously combust during basic demonstrations." Lin stuffed papers into her satchel with unnecessary force. "Your knight training doesn't include accidentally weaponizing vegetables."

"True. I merely lecture people about proper form until they achieve unconsciousness through boredom." Greta retrieved a fallen vial, examining the residue coating its glass interior with the systematic attention she brought to everything. "Though I confess, your results possess certain... memorable qualities."

The walk home led through narrow streets where half-timbered houses leaned companionably together, their diamond-paned windows glowing amber in the slanted light. Lin's shoulders gradually unknotted as familiar domestic warmth replaced the market's chaos.

Their rented house sat wedged between a clockmaker's shop and a textile merchant, its ground floor dominated by the large hearth that Willi had claimed as her engineering laboratory. Steam rose from various pots, filling the air with savory promise that made Lin's stomach growl despite her wounded pride.

"How many explosions today?" Tobi called from his perch near the fireplace, not bothering to glance up from his lute tuning.

"Three distinct detonations," Lin replied, dropping her satchel near the door with more force than necessary.

"She demonstrates admirable modesty," Greta observed, hanging her sword belt on its designated hook with precise ceremony. "The final exhibition cleared half the square and singed a fruit vendor's awning."

Willi emerged from the kitchen alcove, wooden spoon in one hand and a measuring cup in the other. Her practical gaze assessed Lin's soot-stained condition with the same systematic efficiency she applied to recipe calculations.

"At least no actual human combustion occurred this time. I consider that measurable progress." She gestured toward the hearth with her spoon. "Sit. Food improves everything, especially wounded pride."

Lin sank into the cushioned chair nearest the fire, letting heat seep into her bones and chase away the market's sting. This felt right—the four of them in their shared space, comfortable enough for honest teasing. Not like the Academy's rigid formality or the Church's hushed reverence. Just friends being genuinely themselves.

"The merchant guild representative mentioned they might reconsider our teaching contract," Lin admitted, staring into the dancing flames.

"Their loss," Tobi declared, setting aside his lute with a flourish. "Though perhaps we could market your explosions as entertainment. 'Witness the Eastern witch detonate produce for mere copper pieces.'"

"Tobi," Greta warned, though her tone carried more fond exasperation than actual reproach.

"What? I offer encouragement in my own distinctive style."

Willi handed Lin a steaming mug that smelled of mulled cider and autumn spices—cinnamon, cloves, and something warming that she couldn't identify. "Drink. And cease wallowing. You've been forcing yourself to work within traditional methods when your magic clearly desires different approaches."

Lin wrapped both hands around the warm ceramic, grateful for the practical comfort Willi always provided—food, rest, honest observation delivered without judgment. "Maybe I should accept that research suits me better than teaching."

"Or maybe," Greta said carefully, settling into her own chair with the measured grace of someone trained in formal court behavior, "you should examine why your methods consistently... expand beyond their intended parameters."

The firelight caught the thoughtful expression on Greta's face, highlighting the gentle concern that lurked beneath her knightly composure. Lin had learned to read those subtle shifts—Greta trying to offer guidance without overstepping bounds, weighing duty against friendship.

"The expansion isn't intentional," Lin protested. "I follow formulations exactly. Add prescribed ingredients in proper sequence. But then something feels wrong, like the magic wants to flow elsewhere, and—"

"Boom," Tobi finished cheerfully. "Spectacular, aromatic boom that entertains the entire market."

"It's almost as if," Greta continued, methodically working through the logic, "your magical nature conflicts with traditional approaches. Perhaps forcing conformity creates inherent instability."

Before Lin could respond, urgent knocking shattered their domestic peace. Not the polite rap of neighbors or the measured knock of official business, but desperate hammering that spoke of genuine crisis.

Willi set down her spoon and moved toward the door, practical instincts already cataloging potential problems. Greta's hand drifted toward her sword—not drawing, but ready for whatever came next.

The door opened to reveal four travel-stained adventurers, their gear marking them as seasoned professionals rather than amateur fortune-seekers. The leader—a weathered woman with intricate braids and eyes that had seen too much—clutched a leather satchel against her chest like a sacred relic.

"We require magical consultation," she announced without preamble, exhaustion bleeding through forced professionalism. "Guild registry indicates you're certified practitioners."

Greta rose smoothly, her bearing shifting from relaxed friend to authoritative knight in one fluid motion. "What manner of consultation brings you to seek aid at this hour?"

"We've been traveling south from the northern clan territories," the woman replied, swaying slightly on her feet. "Carrying ceremonial artifacts for Academy evaluation. But something's... changed."

She opened the satchel with reverent care, revealing carved stones wrapped in silk cloth. Even through the fabric, Lin felt something responding—a resonance that tugged at her awareness like a half-remembered melody trying to surface.

"They were dormant when we collected them from abandoned sites," the woman continued, her voice dropping to an almost whisper. "Just decorative pieces the clans left behind. But three days ago, they started singing."

As if summoned by her words, a low harmonic hum filled the room. The wrapped stones pulsed with soft light, their carved surfaces visible through silk like lanterns glowing underwater. The sound seemed to sink into Lin's bones, creating sympathetic vibrations that made her teeth ache and her magical awareness tingle.

"By the Light's grace," Greta breathed, her usual composure cracking as she stared at the artifacts. "What manner of power do these stones carry?"

Lin stood slowly, drawn by instincts she couldn't name or resist. The resonance felt familiar somehow, like an echo of something she'd always known but never heard clearly expressed. Her experimental disasters suddenly made perfect sense—this was what her magic had been reaching toward, this harmonic complexity that traditional brewing methods couldn't contain or channel.

"May I examine them?" she asked, extending her hand toward the satchel.

The lead adventurer hesitated, protective instincts warring with evident desperation. "The guild mage in Nordmark warned they might be dangerous. Recommended immediate Academy containment."

"All the more reason for proper preliminary examination," Greta said with diplomatic precision. "We maintain Academy certification. Any findings would be reported through appropriate channels."

Tobi leaned forward with the keen interest he always showed for potentially profitable complications. "Though I must ask—why bring possibly dangerous artifacts to a residential area instead of proceeding directly to Academy representatives?"

The woman's expression tightened with frustration and something that might have been fear. "Because Academy representatives have proven... difficult to locate recently. And these stones grow more active with each passing day."

Willi crossed her arms, practical suspicion sharpening her voice. "Define 'more active' in specific terms."

"The humming was barely audible three days ago. Yesterday, they began glowing. This morning, our cart horses refused to approach them." She gestured toward the window with a trembling hand. "We had to abandon our transportation two streets away because they started rearing and screaming in terror."

Lin felt the resonance intensify, as if the stones were responding to proximity or focused attention. The sensation reminded her powerfully of standing near laylines during the Grenzfeld crisis—that feeling of vast power flowing just beneath the surface of ordinary reality, waiting for someone with the right knowledge to tap into it.

"The laylines have been unstable since the disasters," Greta observed with the systematic analysis she brought to all problems. "Perhaps these artifacts respond to the disruption somehow."

"Or they're causing additional disruption," the woman replied grimly. "We need to determine which possibility represents reality."

Lin stepped closer, her magical awareness stretching toward the wrapped stones like iron filings drawn to a lodestone. The harmonic vibration seemed to match the frequency of the damaged laylines she'd studied after Grenzfeld, but with additional complexity—layers of resonance that traditional Academy training had never prepared her to understand or interpret.

"I believe," she said carefully, testing her hypothesis as she spoke, "these aren't merely responding to layline disruption. They're designed to work with laylines directly. The patterns carved into the stone surfaces—they're not decorative elements."

She looked up at her friends, seeing understanding dawn in their expressions. This wasn't just another magical curiosity requiring routine evaluation and Academy filing. This was the beginning of something larger, more dangerous, and infinitely more important than anything they'd previously encountered.

The stones pulsed brighter, their harmonic song growing stronger as if approving her deduction, and Lin realized her comfortable domestic life had just shattered beyond repair. Whatever these artifacts represented, they demanded investigation. And investigation would require traveling to their source—the northern territories where traditional knowledge still survived, where Academy authority grew thin, and where answers waited among ancient stones that sang with power.

But first, she needed to document everything properly. And that meant involving Greta in the systematic recording that her noble training demanded.

"Greta," she said, turning to her friend with sudden urgency, "we need your documentation skills. This discovery could change everything we understand about layline magic, but only if we record it correctly from the beginning."

Greta nodded slowly, her expression shifting to the focused intensity she brought to important duties. "I'll fetch my writing materials and begin a proper investigation log. If these artifacts possess the power you suggest, the Church and Academy will require detailed reports."

She moved toward their shared desk with characteristic efficiency, already mentally organizing the documentation process that would capture every relevant detail. Lin watched her friend's systematic approach with gratitude—Greta's methodical nature would ensure nothing important was overlooked or forgotten.

"While she prepares the documentation," Willi said practically, "we should probably examine these stones properly. And figure out what we're actually dealing with before making any commitments."

Tobi grinned, his eyes bright with the anticipation that always accompanied potential adventure. "Sounds like we're about to discover something that'll turn our comfortable life completely upside down."

The lead adventurer looked between them with visible relief warring against continued concern. "Then you'll accept responsibility for evaluation and containment?"

Lin glanced at her friends—Greta already arranging writing materials with precise ceremony, Willi calculating practical considerations, Tobi eager for whatever came next. They'd follow her lead, trust her judgment, support whatever decision she made. The weight of that trust felt heavier than the magical resonance filling their home.

"Yes," she said, the word emerging with more certainty than she felt. "We'll take responsibility."

As the commitment left her mouth, the stones sang louder, their light brightening until silk could no longer contain the radiance. Whatever she'd just agreed to, the artifacts approved. And somehow, that felt more ominous than reassuring.
