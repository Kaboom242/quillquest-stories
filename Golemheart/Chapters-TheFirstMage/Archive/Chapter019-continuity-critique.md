# Chapter 19 Continuity Critique

## Major Continuity Issues

**Rating: 4/10** - Severe narrative discontinuity that breaks reader immersion

### Critical Problems:

1. **Korren Appears Without Introduction**
   - Chapter 18 ends with the party camping alone in the Wild Lands
   - Chapter 19 opens with Korren at their campfire as if she's been there all along
   - No explanation of who she is, how they met, or why they trust her
   - Readers are completely lost about this central character

2. **Missing Transition Between Chapters**
   - No bridge showing how they encountered clan members
   - No establishment of their current location or circumstances
   - Chapter 19 assumes knowledge the reader doesn't have

3. **Character Authority Issues**
   - Korren immediately takes teaching/leadership role without justification
   - Why would Greta trust someone who advocates heretical practices?
   - No establishment of Korren's credentials or clan standing

### Specific Continuity Gaps:

- How did they find the clan gathering?
- When did they meet Korren and other clan members?
- What convinced them to participate in forbidden rituals?
- Why is Greta comfortable with someone promoting heretical practices?
- How did they travel from random camping to organized clan gathering?

### Impact on Story Flow:

- **Reader Confusion**: Major character appears without context
- **Trust Issues**: No basis for group trusting Korren's guidance
- **Theological Problems**: Greta's participation seems inconsistent
- **World-building Gaps**: Missing explanation of clan structure/customs

## Required Fixes:

1. **Establish Korren's Introduction**: Show how they meet her and establish her authority
2. **Bridge the Location Gap**: Explain how they found/joined the clan gathering
3. **Address Greta's Concerns**: Show her internal struggle with participating in heretical practices
4. **Clan Context**: Establish the gathering's significance and dangers
5. **Trust Building**: Show why the party accepts Korren's guidance despite risks

## Revision Strategy:

- Add opening section showing encounter with Korren
- Establish her as respected clan elder with specific expertise
- Show party's debate about participating in forbidden rituals
- Build Greta's internal conflict about Church doctrine vs. witnessed reality
- Create proper transition from Chapter 18's camping to organized gathering
