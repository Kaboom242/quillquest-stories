# Chapter 15: The Haunted Bridge - Completion Draft 2

Lin breathed deeply as her horse crested the final hill before the Silberbach valley, savoring air that tasted properly of summer grass instead of the metallic corruption they'd left behind at Rowan Hollow. Her muscles finally unknotted from the tension of working so close to layline torture, and she let herself appreciate the clean morning light that turned the surrounding farmland into gold and emerald patches.

The reprieve lasted exactly until she extended her magical senses toward their destination and felt the tangle waiting ahead—not the screaming agony of corrupted magic, but something that pulled at her chest with the weight of old grief and unfinished business.

"Bridge has been impassable for five days," Willi said, unfolding their contract against her saddle horn with the methodical attention she brought to all their jobs. "Merchants report seeing figures that vanish when approached, and water that speaks in voices of the drowned." Her frown suggested she found the latter claim particularly dubious. "Local garrison tried to clear it twice, but their horses refuse to set hoof on the stones."

Tobi strummed a melody that bounced cheerfully off the hills around them. "Horses have more sense than most soldiers. They can smell death magic from a mile away, unlike humans who require actual corpses before asking uncomfortable questions."

As they descended toward the river, Lin watched the bridge resolve from distant smudge to detailed architecture. Five graceful stone arches should have carried travelers safely across the Silberbach's summer flow. Instead, frost glittered along railings that should have been warm with afternoon sun, and mist rose from dark water in spirals that defied every natural law Lin knew.

Pale figures moved back and forth across the span like moths trapped against glass, their movements visible even from half a mile away. Something about their desperate repetition made Lin's throat tighten with sympathetic anguish. These weren't the chaotic flailings of corrupted spirits—they moved with purpose, as if eternally searching for something just beyond their reach.

"The Light has shown me visions of restless spirits in my prayers," Greta said, her armor creaking as she studied the haunted span ahead. "Souls trapped between this world and the next, unable to find peace." Her voice carried the weight of experience with such hauntings. "They often manifest near water, which holds memories longer than stone or earth."

The south approach to the bridge had become an impromptu camp where frustrated travelers waited for passage that might never come. Lin dismounted near a weathered merchant whose wagon sat heavy with goods bound for northern markets, his face carrying the exhausted frustration of someone forced to watch the same impossible sight for too many days.

"Started right after the big storm passed through," he told her when she asked about the haunting. His voice held the hollow quality of someone who'd told this story too many times. "Water rose faster than anyone's seen in living memory—came down from the mountains like a wall. When it finally went down again, they were there." His pointing finger trembled slightly as he indicated the ghostly figures. "Keep reaching for something in the water, searching and searching, but they can't quite touch whatever it is."

Lin left her horse with the others and approached the bridge itself, immediately feeling the wrongness that had spooked every animal for miles. The temperature dropped with each step toward the stone approach, the chill biting through her summer clothes like winter wind sharp enough to cut skin. Her breath began coming out in white puffs despite the afternoon sun warming her shoulders, and frost crunched under her boots where it had no business existing.

The laylines beneath the ancient stones felt tangled but not corrupted when she extended her magical senses toward them—twisted into knots that spoke of sudden violence and desperate urgency rather than the deliberate torture she'd experienced at Rowan Hollow. When she pressed deeper with her consciousness, images flashed through her mind: dark water rushing higher than should have been possible, desperate voices calling over the thunder of flash flood, reaching hands that couldn't quite span the distance to something precious being swept away by the merciless current.

"There was a tragedy here," she said, the certainty settling cold and heavy in her chest. "Something sudden that left them unable to move on. But they're not feeding on the laylines like the corrupted tree was—they're just stuck, trapped by something they couldn't finish."

Tobi's lute sang a soft, questioning melody into the unnatural chill, and Lin watched one of the ghostly figures pause in its endless pacing to turn toward the sound. For one heartbreaking moment, features resolved from pale mist—a young woman's face marked with desperate longing and unbearable sadness, hope and terror warring in eyes that seemed to look directly at Lin before dissolving back into translucent fog.

"Music draws them," Lin realized, her voice barely above a whisper as understanding began to crystallize. "They're still connected to the living world somehow. That's why they can't pass on—something's anchoring them here, something they need to finish."

As afternoon wore toward evening and shadows lengthened across the valley, the spirits became more solid, their movements more frantic. Lin could now make out details she'd missed from a distance—travel cloaks that rippled in no earthly wind, sturdy boots that left no prints on frost-covered stone, the practical garments of people caught by disaster while journeying far from home.

A ghostly man in a leather coat paced the bridge's center, repeatedly examining something cupped in his translucent hands while his face twisted with anguish that made Lin's chest ache. Near the northern end, two women held what might have been a length of rope, their mouths moving in conversation no living ear could hear.

The breakthrough came as true dusk approached and the temperature around the bridge plummeted until thick ice began forming on the stone railings. Lin pressed close enough to the haunted span that her skin stung with supernatural cold, straining to catch fragments of voices that drifted like whispers carried on wind that touched nothing but her ears:

"—find the rope, someone find the rope—"
"—too deep, water's too deep, can't reach—"
"—baby's crying, dear Light, where's the baby—"

The words hit Lin like a physical blow, stealing her breath and sending ice through her veins that had nothing to do with the unnatural chill. Understanding crashed over her with horrible clarity, each piece of the puzzle falling into place with the weight of a gravestone.

"They're not the ones who died," she whispered, horror and pity warring in her chest as she stared at the desperate spirits. "They're the ones who lived through it. They're trying to save someone who's still down there."

She pointed with a shaking hand toward the water beneath the bridge's central arch, where current ran deepest and swiftest around obstacles she couldn't see. "There's someone in the river. Someone they couldn't save when the flood hit, and now they're trapped here trying to finish the rescue. They've been searching for five days straight, reaching for someone who's beyond any mortal help."

The implications made her stomach turn with nausea that had nothing to do with magical corruption. Seven people had survived whatever catastrophe struck this bridge, but their inability to save one person—one baby, if the ghostly voices spoke true—had bound them here more completely than any curse.

Greta strode toward the bridge with purpose that made her armor ring like funeral bells. "Then we finish what they started," she declared, her voice carrying the absolute conviction that had always marked her dedication to protecting the innocent. "No soul should be lost when help is possible, whether they draw breath or not."

The cold bit deeper as Lin stepped onto the haunted span, each footfall sending vibrations through stone that seemed to wake something in the dark water below. The spirits drew closer, their forms becoming more solid as her living warmth touched the ancient stones. She could see them clearly now—a merchant family caught by the flood, their faces etched with anguish that had been growing stronger with each passing day.

Lin knelt at the bridge's center, the ice-covered stone biting through her clothes as she pressed both palms against the arch. When she extended her consciousness down through the twisted laylines, what she found made her gasp in recognition. The spiritual energy wasn't just tangled—it was being deliberately channeled, woven into a pattern she'd seen before in her grandmother's stories.

"A preservation weave," she breathed, understanding flooding through her as she traced the intricate pattern with her magical senses. "You've been holding her in a spirit-made pocket, keeping her consciousness separate from her body. She's not drowning—she's sleeping."

The ghostly man with the leather coat knelt beside her, his translucent form flickering with desperate hope. When he spoke, his voice came through the laylines themselves: "We couldn't reach her body, but we could touch her spirit. Wrapped her soul in our love and kept it safe while her body... while the water..." His voice broke with five days of accumulated anguish.

Lin felt the delicate web of spiritual energy they had woven, an impossibly complex pattern that had suspended the baby's consciousness outside of time while her physical form waited motionless in the dark water. It was a technique that should have been beyond untrained spirits, but love had given them strength and desperation had provided the focus.

"I can bring her back," Lin said, though the words cost her as she realized what would be required. "But someone has to anchor her spirit while I retrieve the body. Someone has to take the place of seven souls holding the pattern together."

Without hesitation, Greta knelt beside her and placed armored hands on the stone. "I'll hold her," she said with the absolute conviction that had always marked her faith. "By the Light that guides all souls, I will not let this child be lost."

Lin nodded and began the most dangerous magic she had ever attempted. She had to temporarily merge her consciousness with that of the drowned baby, using her own life force to guide the child's spirit back into her physical form while simultaneously retrieving that body from the river bottom. Any mistake would trap them both in the dark water, creating two more spirits bound to the haunted bridge.

The transformation of her blackthorn staff into a lifeline nearly killed her. Lin felt years of her own life flowing into the wood as it extended and strengthened, the Forest Spirit within crying out in pain as she demanded more power than it was meant to provide. But the rope that emerged glowed with silver light and possessed strength beyond any natural fiber, capable of bearing weight and channeling her magical connection to the child below.

Lin's consciousness dove through the icy water like a falling star, following the thread of connection to where the baby's body waited in perfect preservation. What she found was a miracle—five days under water, but the infant showed no signs of decay or damage. The spirits' love had protected more than just her soul.

The retrieval was the hardest thing Lin had ever done. She had to guide the rope with her mind while simultaneously merging her consciousness with the baby's spirit, coaxing the child's soul back into the physical form that had been waiting in the dark. Each second stretched like an hour, and she could feel her own life force draining away with the effort.

When the small bundle finally broke the surface, Lin was shaking with exhaustion that went bone-deep. The baby in her arms was pale and still, her tiny chest not moving. For one terrible moment, Lin thought they had arrived too late—that the preservation had failed in the final moment of rescue.

Then Greta placed her gauntleted hands on the child's chest and spoke a word of power that blazed with divine light. The baby's eyes opened, and she drew her first breath in five days with a wail that echoed across the Silberbach valley like a song of triumph over death itself.

The moment the child breathed freely again, the change in the spirits was immediate and profound. The desperate urgency that had held them to the mortal world for five days melted away like snow under spring sunshine. The ghostly father knelt beside his daughter with tears of pure joy streaming down his translucent face.

"She's safe," he whispered, his voice carrying through the laylines with emotion too deep for mere words. "Our little Anna is safe. We can rest now. We can finally go home."

One by one, the spirits began to fade as the bonds holding them dissolved. They had completed what they started—their daughter lived, their love had triumphed over death itself. The bridge warmed as their supernatural presence departed, frost melting from the railings as summer evening returned to the ancient stones.

The baby's cries attracted the stranded travelers, and soon Lin found herself surrounded by grateful merchants who had been trapped for days. A woman with children of her own took charge of Anna's immediate care, wrapping her in warm blankets while others began organizing proper shelter and food.

Lin sat against the bridge railing, utterly drained by the magic she had performed. The transformation of her staff had cost her dearly—she could feel the years of life she had poured into the spell, payment that could never be reclaimed. But as she watched little Anna nestled safely in caring arms, she knew the price had been worth paying.

"Seven souls refused to abandon their child," Greta said quietly, settling beside Lin as normal traffic began flowing across the span once more. "In the end, love proved stronger than death."

Lin nodded, watching the Silberbach flow toward distant seas. The laylines beneath the bridge ran clean and straight now, carrying the story of this night to every corner of the magical world. The haunted bridge would trouble travelers no more, but the tale of the family who wouldn't surrender their daughter would echo through the spiritual realm for generations yet to come.
