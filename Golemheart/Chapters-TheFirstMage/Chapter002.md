# Chapter Two: Spirits in the Soup

Lin Xiu discovered three important things during her first week of independent magical research: first, that the Royal Academy's library contained exactly zero useful books about Eastern magic; second, that trying to recreate her grandmother's breathing exercises in a dusty library made her sneeze uncontrollably; and third, that the ancient texts in the restricted section apparently had opinions about who should be reading them.

She was currently engaged in what could charitably be called a philosophical disagreement with a particularly stubborn volume titled "Pre-Institutional Magical Practices of the Eastern Reaches" when the book decided it had had quite enough of her questions and snapped itself shut on her fingers.

"Ow! That's not very scholarly of you," Lin muttered, trying to pry the book open again. It seemed to have developed the magical equivalent of lockjaw.

"Having trouble there, sweetie?"

Lin looked up to find a curvy woman in deep blue mage robes approaching her table, carrying the most wonderfully aromatic bowl she'd ever encountered. The woman had rosy cheeks that suggested she spent a lot of time around cooking fires, and her brown hair was twisted into what appeared to be a bun held together by willpower and possibly minor magic.

"The book is being uncooperative," Lin said, still tugging at the covers. "I think it's offended that I don't know the proper reading protocols for ancient texts."

"Ah, you've met Bertram," the woman said cheerfully, setting the bowl down and giving the book a gentle pat. "He's always been a bit temperamental. You have to sweet-talk him."

"Sweet-talk a book?"

"Of course! Everything responds butter to kindness than force—books, soufflés, explosive magical manifestations." The woman winked at her own pun. "I'm Wilhelmina Zuckermann, but everyone calls me Willi. And you must be Lin Xiu, the girl who's got Professor Aldrich questioning everything he thought he knew about magical theory."

Lin blushed. "I wouldn't say everything..."

"Honey, when a student makes a flame that hums lullabies and reveals laylines to an entire classroom, professors start having egg-sistential crises about their understanding of fundamental magical principles." Willi grinned at her own wordplay. "But we can discuss your revolutionary impact on Academia later. Right now, we need to address the fact that you've been sitting here for four hours without eating anything, and that soup is going to get cold."

Lin looked down at the bowl. The contents seemed to shimmer with their own inner light, and she could swear she saw tiny vegetables dancing in the golden broth. "Is this supposed to glow like that?"

"Only when it's made properly!" Willi said with obvious pride. "This is my signature study soup—enhances mental clarity, restores magical energy, and tastes like your grandmother's kitchen on the best day of your childhood. The glow comes from properly harmonized ingredients working in magical sympathy."

Lin took a cautious sip and immediately felt warmth spread through her entire body, followed by a sense of alertness that had nothing to do with caffeine and everything to do with magic settling into perfect balance. But there was something else, too—a feeling of welcome, as if the soup itself was pleased to be fulfilling its purpose.

"This is incredible," she said, taking another spoonful. "It's not just nourishing, it's... happy?"

Willi's eyebrows shot up. "You can sense the soup's emotional state?"

"I... maybe? It feels content. Satisfied with being exactly what it's supposed to be." Lin paused with the spoon halfway to her mouth. "That's weird, isn't it?"

"Sweetie, after what Professor Aldrich told me about your layline sensitivity, I'd say it's perfectly normal for you." Willi leaned forward with obvious interest. "What else can you sense emotions from?"

Lin considered this while continuing to eat the remarkably happy soup. "Plants, sometimes. The library cat seems perpetually judgmental. And..." She glanced around the restricted section, then lowered her voice. "Some of these old books feel lonely. Like they miss being read."

"Fascinating!" Willi clapped her hands together. "You know, most people would say you're just being imaginative, but I've always suspected there's more awareness in the world than we give credit for. Take cooking, for instance—I swear my ingredients work better when I thank them for their contribution to the meal."

"You thank your ingredients?"

"Absolutely! A properly grateful carrot will roast more evenly than one that feels taken for granted. Though I have to say, onions are much more emotional—they always make me cry when I chop them, but I think it's from joy at being part of something delicious." Willi's eyes twinkled with mischief. "The proof is in the pudding—literally! My magical cooking techniques work better when I treat each ingredient as a partner rather than just raw material. You could say it's about thyme and place for everything." when I treat each ingredient as a partner rather than just raw material."

Lin felt a flutter of excitement. "My grandmother used to say something similar about magic itself. That it worked better when you approached it as a collaboration rather than a conquest."

"Smart woman, your grandmother. What else did she teach you about Eastern magical approaches?"

"Well..." Lin glanced at the stubborn book, which was still firmly closed despite her earlier efforts. "She talked about spirits. Not the big, dramatic kind you read about in adventure stories, but small, quiet ones that live in everything—trees, streams, even the wind. She said they were like gardeners, tending to the world in ways people don't usually notice."

"And you believe in these spirits?"

Lin flushed. "I know it sounds childish—"

"It doesn't sound childish at all," Willi interrupted firmly. "It sounds like someone taught you to pay attention to things most people ignore. Which, frankly, might explain why you can see laylines without enhancement and why ancient books develop opinions about you."

She reached over and placed her hand on the closed volume. "Bertram, sweetie, this young lady is trying to learn about the magical traditions her grandmother shared with her. She's not here to exploit old knowledge or make fun of different approaches—she just wants to understand her own abilities better. Could you possibly find it in your papery heart to cooperate?"

The book remained stubbornly closed for several seconds. Then, with what sounded suspiciously like a sigh, it popped open to reveal pages covered in elegant script and detailed illustrations of people performing unfamiliar magical gestures.

"There we go," Willi said with satisfaction. "A little respect goes a long way with the older texts. They remember when scholars approached them as sources of wisdom rather than just reference materials."

Lin stared at the open book, then at Willi. "How did you do that?"

"Same way I make perfect soufflés and convince stubborn flames to behave themselves—by treating everything like it has feelings, because in my experience, most things do." Willi stood up and began gathering several other books from nearby shelves. "Now, let me show you some volumes that might actually be helpful for your research. The Academy's main collection is all very proper and Western-focused, but down here in the restricted section, we've got some treasures that predate the institutional approach to magic."

As Willi selected books with obvious familiarity, Lin found herself studying her new acquaintance with curious eyes. There was something about the way Willi moved through the library—greeting certain books like old friends, automatically adjusting the position of an elderly tome that was sliding off its shelf, pausing to dust off a volume that looked particularly neglected.

"Willi?" Lin said as she watched her reschedule a stack of books that had apparently fallen over. "Have you spent a lot of time down here?"

"Oh yes, I practically lived in the restricted section during my advanced studies. These old books can be cranky, but they contain knowledge you won't find anywhere else." Willi set down an armload of volumes on Lin's table. "Plus, I've always found that the older texts are much more open-minded about unconventional approaches to magic."

Lin opened one of the new books and found herself looking at illustrations of people working magic in ways that seemed somehow familiar, even though she'd never seen the techniques before. "These drawings... they remind me of things my grandmother described."

"I'm not surprised. A lot of these pre-institutional texts describe magical approaches that were common before the Academy system standardized everything." Willi settled back into her chair. "Speaking of which, Professor Aldrich asked me to discuss an opportunity with you."

"What kind of opportunity?"

"The kind that involves getting out of dusty libraries and doing some practical magical development," Willi said with a grin. "I'm a Silver-rank adventurer, currently between contracts and looking for an interesting project. Professor Aldrich thinks you'd benefit from some hands-on experience with your abilities, and I think it would be fascinating to work with someone who approaches magic the way you do."

Lin nearly dropped her spoon. "You want me to become an adventurer?"

"I want you to explore what you're capable of in situations where unconventional thinking is an asset rather than a problem," Willi clarified. "The Adventurer's Guild has plenty of contracts that require magical expertise, and someone who can see laylines clearly and work with them intuitively would be incredibly valuable for certain types of missions."

"But I don't know anything about being an adventurer!"

"That's what mentors are for, sweetie. I've been doing this for eight years, and I'm very good at keeping people alive while they figure out their abilities." Willi's expression became more serious. "Besides, I have a feeling that trying to develop your magical approach within the confines of Academy structures might be like trying to grow an oak tree in a flower pot—technically possible, but not conducive to reaching your full potential."

Lin looked down at the books Willi had gathered, all filled with magical approaches that valued intuition and partnership over control and dominance. "What would we be doing, exactly?"

"Initially, simple contracts—herb gathering, minor monster problems, escort missions. Nothing too dangerous while you learn practical skills." Willi's eyes sparkled with enthusiasm. "But as you develop your abilities... well, let's just say that someone who can sense the emotional states of magical phenomena might discover some very interesting applications for that talent."

"Like what?"

"Well, for instance," Willi said, lowering her voice conspiratorially, "most adventuring teams have trouble with dungeon navigation because they can't tell when the magical currents are stable versus when they're about to shift unexpectedly. Someone who can feel whether the laylines are content or agitated? That's not just useful, that's potentially life-saving."

The possibility sent a thrill through Lin that had nothing to do with magical soup enhancement. For months, she'd felt like her abilities were problems to be solved rather than gifts to be developed. The idea that they might actually be valuable—that she might be able to help people rather than accidentally exploding their classrooms—was almost too wonderful to believe.

"There's just one condition," Willi added with mock seriousness.

"What's that?"

"You have to promise me you'll eat regular meals. I've seen too many young mages get so focused on their magical development that they forget their bodies need fuel too. And trust me, trying to cast spells on an empty stomach is a recipe for disaster—and not the good kind of recipe that involves chocolate. It's just not grate when you're trying to cheese victory from the jaws of defeat!"

Lin laughed, feeling lighter than she had in weeks. "I promise to eat regular meals."

"Excellent! Then let's get you set up for success." Willi stood and began organizing the books she'd selected. "First, we'll spend the rest of today going through these texts and identifying techniques that resonate with what your grandmother taught you. Then tomorrow, we'll visit the Adventurer's Guild and get you registered for a mentorship arrangement."

As they settled in to read, Lin found herself marveling at how different it felt to study magic with someone who approached it as a conversation rather than a conquest. Willi made little encouraging sounds when Lin pointed out interesting passages, asked thoughtful questions about her grandmother's teachings, and somehow managed to make even academic research feel like a shared adventure.

"Willi?" Lin said after they'd been reading for a while. "Can I ask you something?"

"Of course, sweetie."

"When you thank your ingredients, do you ever... feel like they're responding? Like they're actually listening?"

Willi looked up from the book she'd been examining and smiled. "You know, I've never admitted this to anyone, but yes. Sometimes I swear my vegetables perk up when I talk to them, and my spices seem to release more flavor when I acknowledge their contribution to the dish."

"And you don't think that's just imagination?"

"Honey, if imagination makes my food taste better and my magic work more effectively, then imagination is a pretty powerful force in its own right. You might say it's the secret sauce that makes everything come together!" Willi chuckled at her own joke. "But between you and me? I don't think it's just imagination. I think there's a lot more awareness in the world than most people are willing to acknowledge. Sometimes you just have to go with your gut—and speaking of guts, yours is probably wondering where dinner is!"

Lin felt a warm glow of recognition that had nothing to do with magical soup. For the first time since her grandmother's death, someone understood that her way of seeing the world wasn't childish or primitive—it was a different kind of wisdom that deserved respect and cultivation.

As the afternoon wore on and they delved deeper into the ancient texts, Lin began to see patterns emerging between the old magical approaches and her grandmother's teachings. The pre-institutional mages had worked with what they called "the living essence of creation"—a concept that seemed remarkably similar to her grandmother's stories about spirits that tended the world.

More importantly, these ancient practitioners had developed techniques for sensing and working with the emotional states of magical phenomena—approaches that the modern Academy had apparently dismissed as "unscientific folklore."

Lin Xiu had no idea that she was about to rediscover magical techniques that had been lost for centuries, or that her grandmother's "childish stories" would become the foundation for an entirely new form of magical practice.

She only knew that for the first time since arriving at the Academy, studying magic felt like coming home.
