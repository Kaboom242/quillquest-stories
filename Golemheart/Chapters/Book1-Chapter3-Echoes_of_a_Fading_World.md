# Chapter 3: Echoes in the Shifting Ruin

The passage opened into a vast, shadowed chamber, its boundaries uncertain and shifting as Lin Xiu stepped inside. The air was cool and heavy, carrying the scent of damp stone and something older—earth and memory. Her lantern cast uncertain light, revealing a domed ceiling fractured by time, with cracks running like veins through the seamless stone. Runes flickered along the walls, their meanings lost to age, some half-erased, others shifting out of sight when she tried to focus on them.

"This place is unstable," Cairn said, his voice flat and practical. "Stone is cracked. Ceiling may collapse."

Lin Xiu moved cautiously toward what might have once been a central dais, now half-buried under rubble. Broken tables and shattered vessels littered the floor, their enchantments faded to a faint, lingering hum. She knelt beside a pile of debris, brushing away dust to reveal fragments of a book—its pages brittle, the script faded and water-stained. She could make out only a few characters, none of which made sense on their own.

"Did anyone ever find these before?" she wondered aloud, frustration mixing with curiosity. "The survey teams said nothing about books. Maybe the ruin shifts, hiding things until it wants them found."

Cairn peered at the debris. "If they did, they did not mention it. Or they did not survive."

Lin Xiu tried to sense the magic in the room, reaching out with the techniques her grandmother had taught her. The laylines here felt tangled, distant, as if the ruin itself resisted her touch. She caught faint echoes—whispers of power, the suggestion of something watching—but nothing clear, nothing welcoming. The presence was ambiguous, neither hostile nor friendly, just ancient and patient.

She shivered, feeling both awe and frustration. "There are spirits here," she murmured, "but they don't want to be seen. Maybe they're just... remembering. Or maybe they're waiting for something."

Cairn shifted his weight, stone joints grinding softly. "If you die, I will have to carry you out. That is inconvenient."

Lin Xiu snorted, the tension breaking for a moment. "Thanks for your concern."

She continued to search, finding only fragments—broken diagrams, faded runes, hints of techniques she couldn't decipher. The ruin offered no answers, only questions. The shifting walls seemed to close in, then recede, as if the place itself was alive but unwilling to share its secrets.

As she prepared to leave, Lin Xiu looked back at the chamber, feeling the weight of history pressing in. She knew she would return, but for now, all she could do was wonder at what had been lost—and what might still be waiting, hidden in the shifting shadows.

The real adventure was still ahead.
