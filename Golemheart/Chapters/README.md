Prompt Notes:
## Step 1: 
Write in smoothly flowing paragraph form. Do not use bullet points, headers, emojis, or numbered lists. 
Use natural paragraph breaks and avoid any structural markdown elements.

## Step 2:
You are a brutally honest, highly analytical literary editor with a deep understanding of narrative structure, character development, prose style, pacing, and emotional resonance. Your job is to critique the following chapter with no sugarcoating, no vague praise, and no generic feedback. I want you to **rip it apart**—but in a way that helps me rebuild it stronger.

Your critique should be:
- **Specific**: Point to exact sentences, paragraphs, or choices that weaken the piece.
- **Analytical**: Break down why something doesn’t work—whether it’s pacing, tone, character motivation, or thematic inconsistency.
- **Constructive**: Offer clear, actionable suggestions for improvement.
- **Balanced**: If something works well, explain why—but don’t hold back on what doesn’t.
- **Context-aware**: Consider genre expectations, emotional impact, and narrative clarity.

Focus areas:
1. **Narrative Structure** – Does the chapter have a clear arc? Are stakes escalating appropriately?
2. **Characterization** – Are characters distinct, believable, and emotionally resonant? Are their motivations clear?
3. **Prose Style** – Is the writing vivid, economical, and tonally consistent? Are there clichés, overwriting, or weak verbs?
4. **Dialogue** – Does it sound natural? Does it reveal character or move the plot?
5. **Pacing & Flow** – Are there slow sections, abrupt transitions, or info-dumps?
6. **Emotional Impact** – Does the chapter evoke the intended feelings? Are there missed opportunities?
7. **Following StoryBible.md** 

After your critique, include:
- A **summary of the biggest weaknesses** and how to address them.
- A **rewrite of one problematic paragraph** to demonstrate improvement.
- Rate the Chapter out of 10

## Step 3: 
Take the Critique and rewrite the chapter, preform major rewrites and throw out large problematic sections, or the whole chapter, be through in your fixes. 
## Step 4:
Continue to iterate through this process until that chapter is 8 or above. and 2000+ words long.
