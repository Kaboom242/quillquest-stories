# Chapter 4: Sanctuary of Forgotten Light

Lin Xiu’s morning ritual was interrupted by a shrill, breathless voice echoing through the mist: “Hello? Is this the legendary Witchcraft camp? I’m not lost, I’m just… exploring!” Cairn, halfway through reinforcing the tent, didn’t even look up. “That’s the third time she’s circled the stones.” Lin Xiu set her tea down, squinting at the figure stumbling through the dew. The newcomer wore a Ministry-issued cloak two sizes too large, a satchel stuffed with scrolls, and a badge that read “Ministry Apprentice – First Assignment.” Her hair was a wild tangle, and she was currently tripping over a root.

“Hi! I’m Tamsin. I’m here to assist with the survey. I brought… um, a lot of paperwork. And snacks. And a spirit lantern, but I think it’s leaking.” Lin Xiu exchanged a look with Cairn, who shrugged. “Ministry must be desperate.” Tamsin plopped down beside the campfire, nearly knocking over Lin Xiu’s teapot. “So, what’s it like being a real Witchcrafter? Do you get to talk to spirits? Do you eat weird things? Is your golem alive or just, you know, really good at pretending?” Cairn deadpanned, “I’m only alive on weekends.” Lin Xiu grinned, already feeling the day brighten. “You’re welcome to join us, Tamsin. Just don’t touch the spirit-thread. Or the runes. Or the tea, unless you want to see colors that aren’t in the Ministry handbook.” Tamsin’s eyes widened. “Is that a side effect or a feature?” “Depends on the day,” Lin Xiu replied, pouring her tea with exaggerated care.

With Tamsin around, daily routines became a comedy of errors. She tried to help forage, but mistook a patch of magical nettles for edible herbs. “It tingles! Is that good?” She attempted to mend clothes, sewing a Ministry badge onto Cairn’s shoulder. “For official documentation!” She built a rainwater collector that promptly collapsed, soaking everyone’s socks. Cairn’s commentary was relentless. “Ministry protocol: always test the apprentice’s inventions on expendable socks.” Lin Xiu found herself laughing more, even as she fixed Tamsin’s mistakes. The camp felt less like a solemn research site and more like a cozy, chaotic family.

Tamsin was full of questions. “Shouldn’t we report every discovery? The Ministry loves paperwork. And rules. And forms. And—” Lin Xiu groaned. “If we reported every rune, we’d be here until the next Cataclysm.” Cairn added, “The Ministry’s definition of ‘urgent’ is ‘please submit in triplicate.’” Tamsin, undeterred, started a logbook titled “Important Discoveries and Mildly Concerning Incidents.” It quickly filled with entries like “Cairn’s heart glows in the dark” and “Lin Xiu’s tea may be sentient.”

Tamsin was convinced the sanctuary was haunted. “I heard laughter! Or maybe it was the wind. Or a spirit. Or Cairn. Do golems laugh?” Cairn replied, “Only when apprentices trip over their own lanterns.” Lin Xiu let Tamsin tag along on explorations, watching as she tried to interview the runes. “If you’re sentient, blink twice!” Tamsin theorized about magical phenomena, at one point suggesting, “Maybe the sanctuary is a giant magical potato. Potatoes store energy, right?”

Tamsin insisted on helping with experiments. She mixed up spirit-thread and Ministry-issue glow powder, creating a spectacular burst of rainbow light. “I call it ‘Prismatic Threadcraft.’ Is it supposed to hum like that?” Lin Xiu and Cairn spent the afternoon cleaning up, but the laughter lingered. Tamsin’s enthusiasm was infectious, and her wild ideas sometimes led to genuine breakthroughs—if only by accident.

After a failed experiment, Tamsin sat by the fire, clutching a slightly burnt snack. “I just wanted to help. I’m not very good at this yet.” Lin Xiu handed her a cup of tea. “Nobody’s good at Witchcraft on their first try. You’re learning. That’s what matters.” Cairn offered a rare smile. “You haven’t set the camp on fire. Yet.” Tamsin laughed, wiping her eyes. “I’ll try not to. Thanks.”

With three minds at work, the sanctuary’s puzzles became more interesting. Tamsin’s odd questions sometimes revealed hidden patterns. “Why do the runes glow when I sing Ministry hymns off-key?” Lin Xiu realized the sanctuary responded to intent, not just skill. Together, they unlocked a meditation chamber by combining Witchcraft, Ministry ritual, and a healthy dose of chaos.

Evenings were filled with stories, jokes, and Cairn’s dry wit. Tamsin recounted Ministry training disasters, like the time she enchanted a mop that still sends her letters. Lin Xiu shared tales of her grandmother. Cairn offered philosophical musings: “The secret to Witchcraft is surviving apprentices.” The camp felt alive, full of laughter and warmth. The sanctuary seemed to approve, its runes glowing softly in the firelight.

When the Heart Chamber’s runes began to pulse erratically, Tamsin panicked. “Is this normal? Should I fill out a form?” Lin Xiu and Cairn guided her through the process, teaching her to listen, adapt, and trust her instincts. Together, they stabilized the chamber, blending Witchcraft, Ministry ritual, and Tamsin’s creative chaos.

As the chapter closes, Lin Xiu, Cairn, and Tamsin sit by the fire, sharing tea and dreams for the future. The sanctuary feels like home—a place of learning, laughter, and growth. With new friendships forged and mysteries yet to solve, they’re ready for whatever comes next.

The next morning, Lin Xiu decided it was time for Tamsin to experience a proper Witchcraft exploration. “We’re heading into the archive chamber. It’s full of ancient scrolls, traps, and probably a few magical surprises. Ready?” Tamsin bounced on her toes. “I brought my Ministry-issue dust mask and a scroll for ‘Emergency Bureaucratic Intervention.’” Cairn said, “If the scroll starts talking, run.” Inside, the archive was a maze of alcoves and shelves, dust motes swirling in the filtered sunlight. Tamsin immediately tripped over a pile of clay tablets, sending them skittering across the floor. “Sorry! Is this a test? Should I catalogue the debris?” Lin Xiu knelt to help, showing Tamsin how to handle the fragile tablets. “These are records from before the Cataclysm. Treat them like you would a sleeping dragon.” Tamsin nodded solemnly, then sneezed, nearly dropping a tablet. “I think the dragon is allergic to me.” As they explored, Tamsin’s curiosity led her to a hidden alcove. “What’s this? It looks like a puzzle box!” She poked it, and a cloud of magical dust erupted, coating everyone in shimmering blue powder. Cairn remarked, “Ministry protocol: always bring extra laundry.” Lin Xiu laughed, brushing powder from her hair. “Congratulations, Tamsin. You’ve discovered the ancient art of Witchcraft glitter.”

Later, the trio tackled a complex puzzle chamber. Runes shifted in response to their actions, requiring a blend of Witchcraft intuition, Ministry logic, and Tamsin’s wild guesses. “If I recite the Ministry anthem backwards, will it unlock the door?” Tamsin asked. “Only if you do it while hopping on one foot,” Lin Xiu replied. “I’ll supervise. From a safe distance,” Cairn added. After several failed attempts and one accidental summoning of a harmless spirit mouse, Tamsin’s offbeat idea—singing a lullaby to the runes—caused the chamber to unlock. Lin Xiu stared in amazement. “You’re a natural at magical improvisation.” Tamsin beamed. “I just wanted to help. And I like singing.”

That night, the group gathered around the fire. Tamsin shared stories of her disastrous Ministry training, like the time she enchanted a quill to write compliments and it called the examiner ‘Supreme Overlord of Paperwork’ for an hour. Lin Xiu opened up about her grandmother, the loneliness of being a Witchcrafter, and the joy of finding new friends. Cairn, usually reserved, told a story from the manastone’s memory—a festival in the sanctuary, long ago, with laughter, music, and hope. The firelight flickered, and for a moment, the ancient warmth seemed to return. Tamsin wiped her eyes. “I never thought I’d be part of something like this. I always felt… out of place.” Lin Xiu squeezed her hand. “You belong here. We all do.”

The next day, the sanctuary presented a new challenge: a chamber filled with shifting illusions and echoes of old fears. Tamsin hesitated at the threshold. “What if I mess up? What if I get lost?” Lin Xiu smiled. “We’ll stick together. That’s how Witchcraft works.” Inside, the illusions played tricks—showing Tamsin her worst Ministry exam, Lin Xiu her grandmother’s final days, Cairn a memory of being alone. But together, they faced the fears, sharing jokes, encouragement, and the occasional sarcastic quip. “If the illusion tries to make me fill out a form, I’m running,” Tamsin declared. “I’ll bring the mop,” Cairn replied. When the illusions faded, the chamber revealed a new mural—three figures, hand in hand, facing the unknown. Lin Xiu traced the lines, feeling the sanctuary’s approval.

Days passed in a blur of cozy chaos. Tamsin tried to cook, asking, “Is it supposed to bubble like that?” Lin Xiu taught her to weave spirit-thread, reminding, “Left over right, not right over left!” Cairn built a new rainwater collector, declaring, “This one is apprentice-proof.” They explored new chambers, solved puzzles, and made plenty of mistakes. Tamsin’s logbook grew thick with entries: “Discovered a rune that giggles,” “Cairn’s advice: never trust a magical potato,” “Lin Xiu’s tea is still suspicious.”

One evening, as the stars emerged, Lin Xiu confided her worries about the Ministry’s intentions. “They’ll want a full report. But I don’t want this place to become just another project.” Tamsin nodded. “Maybe we can teach them what it means to listen, not just catalogue.” Cairn said, “If the Ministry learns to listen, I’ll eat my badge.” The group laughed, but the moment lingered—a promise to protect the sanctuary’s spirit.

When the Heart Chamber’s anomaly returned, it was more intense. Runes flickered, energy surged, and the room felt alive with challenge. Tamsin panicked, but Lin Xiu and Cairn guided her, blending Witchcraft, Ministry ritual, and Tamsin’s creative chaos. Together, they stabilized the chamber, earning the sanctuary’s trust.

As the chapter ends, the trio sits by the fire, sharing dreams and laughter. The sanctuary glows with gentle approval, and Lin Xiu feels a sense of belonging she’s never known before. With new friendships forged and mysteries yet to solve, they’re ready for whatever comes next.
