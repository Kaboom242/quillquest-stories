# Chapter 3: The Sanctuary's Heart

The morning mist clung to the sanctuary’s entrance, curling around the ancient stones like a living thing. Lin Xiu knelt beside a glowing rune, her breath fogging in the chill air, when the forest erupted with the sound of someone blundering through the underbrush. Branches snapped, roots protested, and a voice—high, flustered, and unmistakably Western—broke the quiet.

“Oh, bother! These roots are positively vindictive, and my robes—oh! Hello there!”

A young woman burst from the treeline, blonde hair wild, Royal Academy robes now a patchwork of leaves and mud. She clutched a satchel to her chest, blue eyes darting between Lin Xiu and the looming figure of Cairn, who watched with the patient amusement of someone used to chaos.

Lin Xiu straightened, dusting clay from her hands. “Um, hello?”

The newcomer’s words tumbled out in a rush. “You must be the Witchcraft expert! I’m Tamsin Brightwater, Junior Researcher, Third Class, Royal Academy of Magical Arts—specializing in Theoretical Elementalism and Applied Enchantment, though I’m much better at theory than practice. The Ministry sent me to assist, but I’ve never seen real Witchcraft before, and most of what I learned suggested it was, well, primitive?”

Lin Xiu’s eyebrows rose. Cairn’s crystalline heart pulsed with silent laughter. “Primitive?”

Tamsin flushed. “Not that I meant—Professor Aldrich always said Eastern magic was more… intuitive? Less rigorous than proper spellcraft? But he also insisted golems were theoretical, so perhaps—” Her gaze landed on Cairn’s seven-foot frame. “Oh my.”

“Good morning,” Cairn said, voice warm and earthy. “I am Cairn. Apparently, I am also theoretical.”

Tamsin squeaked and dropped her satchel. Scrolls and vials scattered, a compass spun wildly in the sanctuary’s twisted laylines. Lin Xiu knelt to help, catching a glowing vial before it rolled away.

“He’s my partner,” Lin Xiu said, handing back the vial. “And Witchcraft is anything but primitive.”

Tamsin babbled, stuffing supplies into her bag. “Of course! I didn’t mean—The Academy focuses on Western traditions. We had one lecture on Eastern practices, but Professor Aldrich was ill—possibly hungover. I’m here to observe, take notes, provide a Western perspective. Honestly, I think they sent me because I was available and Professor Aldrich wanted me out of the lab after the ward incident.”

Cairn’s mouth twitched. “What sort of incident?”

Tamsin’s flush deepened. “I may have created a localized temporal distortion. Nothing dangerous! Just a section of the library where time moved slower. It wore off after three days, but some students used it to cram for exams.”

Lin Xiu smiled, the tension of the morning easing. Tamsin’s earnestness was oddly endearing, her nervous energy infectious. “Well, temporal mishaps aside, we can use all the help we can get. This place is… unusual.”

She gestured to the sanctuary, where runes danced across stone, shifting in response to the laylines’ pulse. “The magic here is alive. Western theory might not be enough, but a fresh perspective could help.”

Tamsin’s eyes widened. “Pre-Cataclysm runes! The patterns match Mordaunt’s illustrations, but the energy is far more complex. And they’re moving!” She scribbled in her notebook, hands shaking. “The Academy said dynamic arrays were impossible, but clearly the old practitioners knew something we’ve lost.”

Lin Xiu stepped closer, placing her palm on the stone. She whispered a greeting in the old tongue. The runes flared, spiraling outward in ripples. Tamsin gasped. “Incredible! But how? Western theory says pre-programmed responses need ambient mana or an active intelligence—” She paled. “You think something’s conscious in there.”

“I’m certain,” Lin Xiu said. “The question is what, and whether it’s friendly.”

“Or hungry,” Cairn added.

Tamsin squeaked again.

The sanctuary’s corridors twisted, stone archways blooming with runes that pulsed in time with Lin Xiu’s heartbeat. She moved with quiet confidence, fingers tracing glyphs as if greeting old friends. Tamsin stumbled behind, boots catching on uneven flagstones, every incantation dissolving into harmless sparks. The magic refused to obey her commands, responding only to Lin Xiu’s gentle touch and whispered invitations. Frustration etched itself into Tamsin’s brow, her faith in Academy training unraveling with each failed spell.

“I don’t understand,” Tamsin muttered, staring at a ward-knot that ignored her methodical approach. “It’s still mana manipulation, just different symbols.”

“Western magic imposes will,” Lin Xiu said, coaxing the ward open with a strand of spirit-thread. “Witchcraft listens and helps.”

“But that’s not scientific! How do you measure effectiveness?”

Cairn’s voice was mild. “Perhaps harmony matters more than consistency.”

“But magic without consistency is chaos!”

“No,” Lin Xiu said, “it’s art.”

They pressed deeper, the passages branching into chambers that shifted when no one looked directly at them. The architecture defied Western theory, organic curves suggesting growth rather than construction. Tamsin’s frustration mounted. Her detection spells fizzled, her arrays of reagents useless against barriers that responded only to courtesy and patience.

“This is impossible,” she declared after her fifteenth failed attempt. “The mana flows don’t follow any pattern. How did they build this without proper theory?”

“Maybe their foundations were different,” Lin Xiu said, kneeling to whisper an apology to the ward. The magic pulsed warmly, the barrier dissolving.

“But theory is universal!” Tamsin insisted. “Thaumic principles can’t change based on culture!”

“Can’t they?” Cairn asked, dry humor in his voice. “Perhaps your fundamentals aren’t as fundamental as you think.”

Tamsin opened her mouth, then closed it, looking lost. Her academic confidence slipped, revealing vulnerability. “The professors said I was too impractical. Too intuitive. My results were inconsistent. I thought if I could prove myself here, maybe they’d see I could be a real researcher.”

Lin Xiu felt a pang of sympathy. “You don’t need to prove anything to anyone but yourself.”

“Easy for you to say,” Tamsin replied, voice bitter. “You’re an expert. You have a partner who respects you and magic that works. I’m just the failure they sent because no one else was available.”

“You’re not a failure,” Lin Xiu said. “You’re using the wrong tools.”

She offered Tamsin a hand. “The Academy taught you to command magic. This place wants to be understood. Maybe try a different approach.”

Tamsin looked skeptical, but took the hand. “You think I could learn Witchcraft?”

“I think you could learn to listen.”

The next hours were a revelation. Lin Xiu rediscovered the joy of teaching, explaining Witchcraft’s principles to someone whose curiosity survived academic conditioning. Tamsin, freed from the pressure to apply Western theory, showed unexpected aptitude for intuition.

“Feel the magic’s intention,” Lin Xiu said at a complex lock. “Don’t solve it like a puzzle. Understand what it wants.”

Tamsin closed her eyes, hands hovering over runes. Her shoulders eased. “It’s… protective? It wants to keep something safe, not hidden?”

“Exactly!” Lin Xiu’s excitement was infectious. “Now ask for permission.”

Tamsin whispered, and the lock chimed, sliding open.

“I did it!” Tamsin’s face lit with delight. “But how? I don’t understand the theory.”

Cairn’s chuckle rumbled through the stone. “Some things are felt, not explained.”

The sanctuary’s heart revealed itself—a chamber alive with light, runes swirling in patterns that sang of memory and hope. Lin Xiu, Cairn, and Tamsin stood together, three traditions converging, the old magic welcoming them not for their mastery, but for their willingness to listen.

For the first time, Tamsin’s nervous energy settled into quiet wonder. Lin Xiu felt the spirits of the land watching, approving. Cairn’s crystalline heart pulsed with gentle pride. The adventure was only beginning, but already, something had changed: three strangers, united by curiosity, had learned to hear the world’s oldest song.
