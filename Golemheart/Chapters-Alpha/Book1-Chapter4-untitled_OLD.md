Lin Xiu’s morning began with the familiar hush of mist curling around the standing stones, the world muffled and expectant. She was halfway through her tea ritual, savoring the earthy blend her grandmother had taught her, when a voice sliced through the quiet—a voice so bright and breathless it seemed to bounce off the stones themselves. “Hello? Is this the legendary Witchcraft camp? I’m not lost, I’m just… exploring!”

Cairn, ever the sentinel, didn’t bother to look up from reinforcing the tent. “That’s the third time she’s circled the stones.”

Lin Xiu squinted through the haze, spotting a figure stumbling through the dew. The newcomer wore a Ministry-issued cloak two sizes too large, a satchel bursting with scrolls, and a badge that read “Ministry Apprentice – First Assignment.” Her hair was a wild tangle, and she was currently tripping over a root, arms flailing in a desperate attempt to stay upright.

“Hi! I’m Tamsin. I’m here to assist with the survey. I brought… um, a lot of paperwork. And snacks. And a spirit lantern, but I think it’s leaking.”

Lin Xiu exchanged a look with Cairn, who shrugged. “Ministry must be desperate.”

Tamsin plopped down beside the campfire, nearly knocking over Lin Xiu’s teapot. “So, what’s it like being a real Witchcrafter? Do you get to talk to spirits? Do you eat weird things? Is your golem alive or just, you know, really good at pretending?”

Cairn deadpanned, “I’m only alive on weekends.”

Lin Xiu grinned, already feeling the day brighten. “You’re welcome to join us, Tamsin. Just don’t touch the spirit-thread. Or the runes. Or the tea, unless you want to see colors that aren’t in the Ministry handbook.”

Tamsin’s eyes widened. “Is that a side effect or a feature?”

“Depends on the day,” Lin Xiu replied, pouring her tea with exaggerated care.

With Tamsin around, daily routines became a comedy of errors. She tried to help forage, but mistook a patch of magical nettles for edible herbs. “It tingles! Is that good?” She attempted to mend clothes, sewing a Ministry badge onto Cairn’s shoulder. “For official documentation!” She built a rainwater collector that promptly collapsed, soaking everyone’s socks. Cairn’s commentary was relentless. “Ministry protocol: always test the apprentice’s inventions on expendable socks.”

Lin Xiu found herself laughing more, even as she fixed Tamsin’s mistakes. The camp felt less like a solemn research site and more like a cozy, chaotic family.

Tamsin was full of questions. “Shouldn’t we report every discovery? The Ministry loves paperwork. And rules. And forms. And—”

Lin Xiu groaned. “If we reported every rune, we’d be here until the next Cataclysm.”

Cairn added, “The Ministry’s definition of ‘urgent’ is ‘please submit in triplicate.’”

Tamsin, undeterred, started a logbook titled “Important Discoveries and Mildly Concerning Incidents.” It quickly filled with entries like “Cairn’s heart glows in the dark” and “Lin Xiu’s tea may be sentient.”

Tamsin was convinced the sanctuary was haunted. “I heard laughter! Or maybe it was the wind. Or a spirit. Or Cairn. Do golems laugh?”

Cairn replied, “Only when apprentices trip over their own lanterns.”

Lin Xiu let Tamsin tag along on explorations, watching as she tried to interview the runes. “If you’re sentient, blink twice!” Tamsin theorized about magical phenomena, at one point suggesting, “Maybe the sanctuary is a giant magical potato. Potatoes store energy, right?”

Tamsin insisted on helping with experiments. She mixed up spirit-thread and Ministry-issue glow powder, creating a spectacular burst of rainbow light. “I call it ‘Prismatic Threadcraft.’ Is it supposed to hum like that?”

Lin Xiu and Cairn spent the afternoon cleaning up, but the laughter lingered. Tamsin’s enthusiasm was infectious, and her wild ideas sometimes led to genuine breakthroughs—if only by accident.

After a failed experiment, Tamsin sat by the fire, clutching a slightly burnt snack. “I just wanted to help. I’m not very good at this yet.”

Lin Xiu handed her a cup of tea. “Nobody’s good at Witchcraft on their first try. You’re learning. That’s what matters.”

Cairn offered a rare smile. “You haven’t set the camp on fire. Yet.”

Tamsin laughed, wiping her eyes. “I’ll try not to. Thanks.”

The days blurred together in a gentle rhythm, each morning bringing new discoveries and new mishaps. Tamsin’s attempts at spellwork were a spectacle in themselves. She tried to conjure a breeze to clear the mist, but only succeeded in making Cairn’s cloak flutter and Lin Xiu’s tea swirl in its cup. “Western wind magic is supposed to be easy,” she insisted, squinting at her notes. “Maybe the mist is immune?”

Lin Xiu watched with a mixture of amusement and sympathy. “Mist is stubborn. You have to coax it, not command it.”

Tamsin frowned, poking at the air as if she could prod the mist into obedience. “I don’t think coaxing is in the Ministry curriculum.”

Cairn, ever patient, offered, “Try asking nicely. Mist likes manners.”

Tamsin tried, her voice soft and earnest. The mist swirled, then settled, as if considering her request. “Did it work?”

Lin Xiu smiled. “You’re learning.”

Their investigation of the sanctuary grew more focused. Lin Xiu led the way, tracing the shifting runes with careful fingers, her mind racing with possibilities. Cairn mapped the energy flows, his crystalline heart pulsing in time with the sanctuary’s rhythms. Tamsin followed, scribbling notes and asking questions that ranged from insightful to absurd. “If the runes change when you look away, do they get shy? Or are they just bored?”

Lin Xiu explained, “They’re responding to intent. Witchcraft is about listening, not just seeing.”

Tamsin nodded, though her brow furrowed in confusion. “I think I need a new notebook for all the things I don’t understand.”

The trio worked together, each bringing their own strengths and quirks. Lin Xiu’s intuition guided them through hidden passages. Cairn’s steady presence kept them safe from magical traps. Tamsin’s enthusiasm, though often misplaced, sometimes led to unexpected breakthroughs. She accidentally triggered a hidden door by humming a Ministry anthem off-key, revealing a chamber filled with ancient scrolls and glowing crystals.

“Did I do that?” Tamsin gasped, eyes wide.

Lin Xiu laughed. “Sometimes magic likes surprises.”

Cairn added, “Or it’s just tired of Ministry hymns.”

Inside the chamber, Lin Xiu found a pedestal inscribed with runes that shimmered in response to her touch. The scrolls were written in a script she recognized from her grandmother’s teachings, but with variations that hinted at lost traditions. She translated aloud, her voice reverent. “This sanctuary was built to preserve knowledge, to teach those who seek harmony. It’s a refuge, not a fortress.”

Tamsin peered at the scrolls, her eyes crossing as she tried to decipher the script. “I think I see a potato. Or maybe that’s a rune for wisdom?”

Lin Xiu smiled, gently guiding Tamsin’s hand away from the fragile parchment. “Let’s leave the potatoes for lunch.”

Cairn examined the crystals, his fingers tracing the patterns etched into their surfaces. “These are memory stones. They store lessons, stories, maybe even voices.”

Tamsin’s curiosity was boundless. “Can we listen to them? Do they play music?”

Lin Xiu focused her mana, channeling a gentle thread of energy into the nearest crystal. A soft hum filled the chamber, and a voice—ancient, calm, and wise—spoke in a language that resonated with Lin Xiu’s soul. The message was clear: the sanctuary was meant to be a living teacher, adapting to each visitor’s needs, preserving wisdom through connection and care.

Tamsin shivered. “It feels… alive. Like it’s watching us.”

Lin Xiu nodded. “It is. But it’s not dangerous. It wants to be understood.”

Cairn added, “Most places just want to be left alone. This one wants company.”

On the final morning, the sanctuary felt different. The mist was thinner, the stones warmer, and the runes pulsed with a quiet urgency. Lin Xiu sensed a change in the air—a gentle pressure, as if the sanctuary itself was preparing for a transformation.

Tamsin was the first to notice. “The runes are moving faster. Is that normal?”

Lin Xiu shook her head, her heart pounding with anticipation. “It’s responding to us. I think it’s ready.”

Cairn stood beside her, his presence steady and reassuring. “Whatever happens, we’re together.”

The trio gathered in the central chamber, where the memory stones and scrolls glowed with a soft, golden light. Lin Xiu approached the pedestal, her hands trembling. She focused her mana, weaving a thread of intent and gratitude into the sanctuary’s heart.

The runes flared, filling the chamber with light. The walls shimmered, then began to dissolve, the stones flowing like water, the scrolls and crystals merging into a single, radiant sphere. Lin Xiu felt the sanctuary’s presence—warm, wise, and loving—embrace her, Cairn, and Tamsin.

Tamsin gasped, clutching Cairn’s arm. “Is it supposed to do that?”

Cairn replied, “It’s never done it before.”

Lin Xiu closed her eyes, letting the sanctuary’s energy wash over her. She felt memories, lessons, and stories pour into her mind, each one a gift from the ancient teachers who had built this place. The sphere condensed, shrinking until it fit in the palm of her hand—a perfect Autoscribe Grimoriore, inscribed with runes that shimmered with living light.

Lin Xiu cradled the Grimoriore, tears streaming down her face. “It’s not gone. It’s coming with us.”

Tamsin wiped her eyes, sniffling. “Does it have a chapter on potatoes?”

Cairn smiled, his crystalline heart glowing brighter. “If it doesn’t, you can write one.”

The sanctuary’s presence lingered, a gentle warmth in the air. Lin Xiu felt a deep sense of gratitude and loss, knowing that the place she had come to love was now part of her, its wisdom preserved for future generations.

The trio packed their belongings, the camp now quiet and still. Tamsin carefully folded her logbook, Cairn gathered the last of the supplies, and Lin Xiu tucked the Autoscribe Grimoriore into her satchel. They stepped outside, the mist parting before them, the standing stones silent and serene.

As they walked away, Lin Xiu glanced back, her heart aching with farewell. The sanctuary was gone, its stones faded into the earth, its magic now a quiet hum in the laylines. She knew they had changed, each of them carrying a piece of the sanctuary’s spirit.

The journey back to Eldermere was filled with laughter and stories. Tamsin recounted her favorite mishaps, Cairn offered dry commentary, and Lin Xiu shared the lessons she had learned. The road felt lighter, the world brighter, as if the sanctuary’s blessing followed them.

When they reached the city gates, Mira greeted them with a smile. “Back so soon? Did you find anything interesting?”

Lin Xiu held up the Autoscribe Grimoriore, its runes glowing softly. “We found a teacher. And a friend.”

Tamsin added, “And maybe a potato.”

Cairn nodded. “And a new apprentice. The world’s not ready.”

Mira laughed, ushering them inside. The trio entered Eldermere, their hearts full of hope and possibility, ready for whatever adventures awaited them next.

Evenings were filled with stories, jokes, and Cairn’s dry wit. Tamsin recounted Ministry training disasters, like the time she enchanted a mop that still sends her letters. Lin Xiu shared tales of her grandmother. Cairn offered philosophical musings: “The secret to Witchcraft is surviving apprentices.” The camp felt alive, full of laughter and warmth. The sanctuary seemed to approve, its runes glowing softly in the firelight.
