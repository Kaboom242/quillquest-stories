The morning rain drummed against the narrow windows of the Adventurer's Guild's main hall, casting wavering shadows across the polished stone floor. Lin Xiu pulled her cloak tighter around her shoulders as she approached the reception desk, droplets still clinging to the worn fabric despite her best efforts to shake them off in the entryway. The familiar bustle of adventurers checking contracts and haggling over equipment prices filled the air, punctuated by the occasional burst of laughter from a group celebrating a successful mission.

"Lin Xiu!" The cheerful voice of Mira, one of the guild's most experienced receptionists, cut through the morning chatter. The young woman's auburn hair was pulled back in its usual neat bun, though a few rebellious strands had escaped to frame her freckled face. "Perfect timing. I was just about to send someone to find you."

Lin Xiu raised an eyebrow, water droplets from her hood spattering onto the polished counter. "That sounds either very promising or very ominous. Given my recent luck with 'perfect timing,' I'm leaning toward ominous."

Mira laughed, her green eyes sparkling with barely contained excitement. "Oh, it's definitely promising. We've got something special for you—a Bronze-rank contract that's been sitting in our files for almost three months. No one else has been willing to take it on."

"And that's supposed to make me feel better?" Lin Xiu wrung out the hem of her cloak, creating a small puddle on the floor that she pointedly ignored. "When other Bronze-rank adventurers won't touch something, it usually means it's either impossibly boring, impossibly dangerous, or impossibly bureaucratic. Sometimes all three."

"In this case, it's more like impossibly strange." Mira pulled out a thick manila folder from beneath the counter, its edges worn from handling. "It's a dungeon investigation contract. The client is the Ministry of Magical Anomalies—they want someone to document and classify a newly discovered dungeon about two days' travel north of here."

Lin Xiu's interest sharpened immediately. Dungeon work was always fascinating, but a completely new dungeon was rare. Most of the accessible ones had been mapped and catalogued decades ago. "What makes it so strange that no one else will take it?"

"Well," Mira opened the folder and began reading from the top document, "according to the initial survey team, the dungeon doesn't behave like a normal magical phenomenon. The entrance appears to be carved stone rather than a natural layline rupture, and the interior shows signs of deliberate construction. More importantly, the magical signature is completely unlike anything in our classification system."

"Sounds fascinating," Lin Xiu said, though something cold settled in her stomach. Dungeons that didn't follow normal patterns often meant ancient magic was involved, and ancient magic had a tendency to be either incredibly valuable or incredibly dangerous. "What's the catch?"

Mira's expression grew more serious. "Three separate survey teams have gone in over the past few months. All of them came back reporting the same thing—the dungeon seems to respond to their presence, almost like it's aware of them. Walls shift when they're not looking, passages that were mapped one day are completely different the next, and there's a persistent sense that something is watching them."

"That's definitely not standard dungeon behavior." Lin Xiu reached for the folder, her curiosity overriding her caution. "May I?"

As she flipped through the documents, her frown deepened. The survey reports were meticulously detailed, filled with precise measurements, magical readings, and sketched maps. But the more she read, the more obvious it became that each team had explored what seemed like completely different dungeons. The layouts didn't match, the magical signatures varied wildly, and even basic details like the width of corridors and the material of the walls were inconsistent.

One particular note caught her attention, written in the margin of the third survey report in cramped handwriting: "The runes on the walls are not in any known magical script. They seem to shift and change when observed directly. Recommend consultation with specialists in pre-Cataclysm archaeology."

Pre-Cataclysm. Lin Xiu felt a familiar tingle run down her spine, the same sensation she'd experienced as a child when her grandmother spoke of the old times, the lost magics, the great sundering that had split the world and buried so much knowledge. The Cataclysm had happened over ten thousand years ago, but its effects still shaped the world in countless ways. Most of what came before was lost to history, remembered only in fragments and folklore.

"The pay is quite generous," Mira added, clearly noticing Lin Xiu's growing interest. "Fifty gold for a complete survey and classification report, plus a bonus if you can determine the source of the anomalous behavior. And since it's a Ministry contract, all your expenses are covered—food, lodging, equipment replacement if needed."

Fifty gold was more than Lin Xiu typically made in three months of standard contracts. The Ministry clearly wanted this dungeon investigated badly enough to pay premium rates for it. "When do they need the report?"

"There's no strict deadline, but they'd prefer it within the next few weeks. The dungeon's proximity to the northern trade routes has some merchants concerned, especially with the harvest caravans starting to move through the area." Mira leaned forward conspiratorially. "Between you and me, I think the Ministry is worried that if they don't get answers soon, they might have to post a permanent guard detail or even seal the entrance. Neither option is particularly appealing to their budget."

Lin Xiu closed the folder and tapped her fingers against its cover, considering. A shape-shifting dungeon with pre-Cataclysm characteristics was exactly the sort of mystery that made her pulse quicken. The rational part of her mind whispered warnings about ancient magic and its tendency to be unpredictable, but her curiosity was already constructing plans and theories.

"I'll need to bring Cairn," she said finally. "If the dungeon is truly responsive to human presence, having a golem along might provide some interesting contrasts in how it reacts."

"Of course. The contract specifically mentions that familiars and constructed companions are permitted." Mira began preparing the necessary paperwork, her pen scratching efficiently across several forms. "Will you need any special equipment? The Ministry has authorized us to advance funds for items specifically related to this mission."

"I'll want extra etching supplies—clay tablets, good quality ink, and raw materials I can use for talismans and wards. If you have any blank scrolls or unenchanted parchment, I'll take those too. I don't use the standard Western magic scrolls, but I can adapt some of the materials for my own work." Lin Xiu mentally catalogued what she had at home versus what she'd need to purchase. "And I'll need to stock up on barrier materials—herbs, mineral salts, maybe some spirit-thread if you have it. If something in there has been watching survey teams, I'd rather be prepared for the possibility that it might decide to do more than watch."

Mira nodded, making a note. "We have plenty of blank scrolls and unenchanted parchment, and I can authorize the purchase of raw materials. If you need any traditional magical items or scrolls, just let me know."

Lin Xiu smiled, appreciating the offer but knowing most Western magic tools wouldn't suit her needs. "I'll take a look, but I doubt I'll find much that's compatible. Witchcraft is... a bit different."

As Mira filled out the equipment authorization forms, Lin Xiu found herself staring out the rain-streaked windows at the bustling street beyond. Merchants hurried between shops with their cloaks pulled tight against the weather, while a group of children splashed gleefully through puddles despite their parents' scolding. It was such an ordinary scene, full of the comfortable rhythms of daily life in a world where magic was predictable and dungeons followed known rules.

But somewhere to the north, a mystery waited that might challenge everything she thought she knew about how magic worked. The survey reports mentioned runes that changed when observed, architecture that defied mapping, and an awareness that seemed almost alive. It reminded her of stories her grandmother had told, tales of the ancient practitioners who had built wonders that transcended simple spellcraft, who had woven intent and consciousness into their creations in ways that modern magic could barely comprehend.

"Here you go." Mira slid the completed contract across the counter, along with a small bag containing the equipment advance. "The recommended route is through Millbrook and then north along the Cartographer's Trail. There's a waystation about halfway where you can resupply if needed. The dungeon entrance is marked on the map—look for the standing stones arranged in a perfect circle."

Lin Xiu signed her name with a flourish, officially accepting the contract. "Standing stones in a perfect circle definitely sounds like pre-Cataclysm construction. Natural layline ruptures don't create geometric formations."

"That's what the survey teams thought too." Mira stamped the contract with the guild's official seal. "Be careful in there, Lin. I know you have a talent for handling unusual situations, but something about this whole thing feels different from the normal 'strange dungeon' reports we get."

"Different how?"

Mira hesitated, glancing around to make sure no one else was listening. "This is just intuition, you understand, but I've been working here for almost five years. I've processed hundreds of dungeon contracts, read thousands of survey reports. Most anomalies have explanations—corrupted laylines, unstable magical fields, ancient traps that haven't been triggered in centuries. But the reports from this place..." She shook her head. "They read like the dungeon is thinking. Not just responding to stimuli, but actually considering the people inside it and making deliberate choices about how to react."

A chill ran down Lin Xiu's spine that had nothing to do with her damp clothing. Consciousness in constructed spaces was not unheard of in the old stories, but it belonged to magics that had been lost when the Cataclysm shattered the world's laylines. If something from that era had survived intact, hidden and waiting for ten thousand years...

"I'll be careful," she promised, tucking the contract into her satchel. "And I'll send regular progress reports through the communication crystals at the waystation."

The rain had lightened to a gentle drizzle by the time Lin Xiu emerged from the guild hall, but she barely noticed. Her mind was already racing ahead to the preparations she'd need to make, the supplies to gather, the theories to test. Cairn would need to be informed and prepared—her golem companion's unique nature might prove invaluable when dealing with something that seemed to distinguish between different types of consciousness.

As she walked through the familiar streets toward the market district, Lin Xiu found herself thinking about the nature of awareness and intent in magical constructions. Her grandmother had taught her that everything contained a spark of spirit, that the art of Witchcraft was not about imposing will upon the world but about recognizing and harmonizing with the intentions already present in all things. Most modern mages dismissed such ideas as primitive anthropomorphism, but Lin Xiu had seen too much evidence of consciousness in unexpected places to be so quick to rationalize it away.

A dungeon that watched, that changed, that seemed to think—it sounded less like a magical anomaly and more like something that had been deliberately awakened. The question was whether that awakening had been recent or if something ancient had finally stirred from a long slumber. Either possibility carried implications that made her pulse quicken with a mixture of excitement and unease.

The rain continued to fall as she made her way home to begin preparations, each droplet carrying whispers of the adventure to come.
