## Core Philosophy: Genuine Friendship Through Dynamic Interaction

This story succeeds when the characters feel like real friends having authentic conversations that naturally reveal personality while driving plot forward. Focus on **situational dialogue** over quirky behaviors. Each character brings a different perspective that complements the others, creating natural banter that makes any scene engaging.

## The Four-Way Dynamic

These four personalities create a natural harmony of perspectives:
- **Lin** (Innovation) - "What if we try...?"
- **Greta** (Structure) - "Here's how we do this properly"  
- **Tobi** (Flexibility) - "Or we could just..."
- **Willi** (Practicality) - "Before we do anything, we need..."

Their conversations should feel organic, with each person contributing their natural viewpoint to whatever situation they face. Conflict comes from different approaches, not personality clashes.

## Story Priority: Character Interaction Drives Plot

Every scene should feature the four-way dynamic contributing to whatever challenge they face. Their different perspectives create natural problem-solving processes that advance the story while revealing character depth through action and dialogue.

## Example Dialogue Patterns

### Problem-Solving Scene:
**Lin:** "The laylines are twisted here. Maybe if we approach from the spiritual side instead of the magical side?"
**Greta:** "That's risky without knowing what we're dealing with. Honor demands we protect the innocent first."
**Tobi:** "Or I could just charm the locals into telling us everything. Works better when I have three beautiful companions to impress them with." *winks*
**Willi:** "Save your charm for someone gullible, Tobi. And I'm making dinner. Nobody makes good decisions on an empty stomach."

### Character Support Scene:
**Greta:** [after making a mistake] "I have failed in my duty. A true knight should have anticipated this."
**Lin:** "Hey, you couldn't have known. Besides, now we know more than we did before."
**Tobi:** "Plus, watching you be less than perfect makes the rest of us feel better about ourselves, my lady." *cheeky grin*
**Greta:** "Your levity in the face of failure is most improper, knave."
**Willi:** "Here, eat this. Then we figure out what to do next. And Tobi, stop making Greta blush."

### Light Banter Scene:
**Lin:** "I think the spirit wants to help, but it's confused about our intentions."
**Tobi:** "Join the club. Though I'm never confused about my intentions with three lovely ladies." *wiggles eyebrows*
**Greta:** "The Light preserve us from your 'intentions,' rogue. Our purpose is to serve the greater good."
**Lin:** "Down, boy. We're trying to save people here."
**Willi:** "Our intention is to not die horribly. Everything else is bonus. Especially keeping Tobi's ego in check."
