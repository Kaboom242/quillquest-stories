The carriage wheels ground against the cobblestones with a rhythm that matched my heartbeat—steady, inevitable, carrying me toward something I couldn't yet name. Three days had passed since Elder Matthias's confession, three days since the village had looked at me with eyes that held equal parts gratitude and unease. Mother had packed my belongings with the same careful precision she used for her finest embroidery, each fold of fabric deliberate, each decision weighted with unspoken understanding.

"The Guild will suit you," she had said, pressing the letter of introduction into my hands. The parchment still crinkled in my travel satchel, signed by Constable Harwick and bearing the official seal that would grant me entry to the Adventurer's Guild as a clerical assistant. "Your gift isn't meant for hiding, Sora. Perhaps it's meant for helping."

The city of Glyphmere revealed itself gradually through the morning mist, rising from the shores of Lake Valdris like something from the adventure tales sold at market stalls. Towers of white stone and blue-glazed brick stretched toward the sky, their surfaces etched with protective runes that glowed faintly even in daylight. The lake itself sparkled with an almost unnatural clarity, and I could see the shadows of massive structures beneath its surface—sunken ruins from some forgotten age, now serving as foundations for the Guild's underwater archives.

As our carriage joined the steady stream of traffic approaching the city gates, I pressed my face to the window and watched the world expand beyond anything I had ever imagined. Merchant caravans bearing the colors of distant kingdoms rolled past us, their guards wearing armor that hummed with enchantments. A group of what could only be adventurers walked alongside the road, their weapons gleaming with obvious magical enhancement, deep in conversation about something called a "B-rank dungeon clearance." One of them—a tall woman with intricate tattoos covering her arms—carried a staff that left tiny motes of light in the air with each step.

The Guild's presence was everywhere. Blue and silver banners hung from lampposts, marked with the crossed sword and quill that I was beginning to recognize as the symbol of organized adventure. Street vendors sold "authentic monster parts" and "dungeon-tested gear" to wide-eyed tourists, while more serious establishments displayed certificates of Guild approval in their windows. Even the city guards wore small pins indicating their auxiliary status with the organization.

My first glimpse of the Guild headquarters itself made my breath catch. The Victoria Branch—named, according to the brass plaque, for some legendary Guild Master from centuries past—occupied an entire city block. The main building rose seven stories high, its architecture blending practical fortress design with the flowing curves favored by elven architects. Smaller buildings clustered around it like goslings following their mother: the Quartermaster's warehouse, the Healer's hall, the Archives where I would apparently be working, and dozens of other specialized structures connected by covered walkways and carefully maintained gardens.

The carriage driver, a weathered man who had grown increasingly chatty as we approached the city, twisted around to address me as we pulled up to the Guild's main entrance. "First time in Glyphmere, miss? You've got that look about you—like you're seeing the world for the first time."

"Something like that," I admitted, gathering my belongings and checking that my letter of introduction was still safely tucked in my satchel. "I'm starting work at the Guild today."

His eyebrows rose with interest. "Adventurer, are you? You don't look the type for monster hunting, if you don't mind my saying."

"Clerical work," I corrected, though something about the distinction felt less definitive than it should have. "Records and contracts, mostly."

He nodded knowingly as I paid the fare. "Ah, one of the paper-pushers. Don't let anyone tell you that's not important work—half the adventurers in this city would be dead or broke without the clerks keeping their affairs in order. Good luck to you, miss."

The Guild's main hall buzzed with activity that made my village's busiest market day look like a quiet afternoon. Bronze-ranked adventurers—identifiable by the metal threads woven into their gear—clustered around a massive contract board, pointing at various postings and arguing about the relative merits of goblin extermination versus herb gathering missions. Silver-ranked teams moved with more purpose, their conversations conducted in lower tones as they reviewed what were obviously more dangerous assignments. I caught fragments of their discussions: "wyvern nest," "dungeon core instability," "B-rank threat assessment."

The information desk stood like an island of relative calm in the center of the chaos, staffed by a middle-aged woman whose Guild badge bore the distinctive quill marking of administrative personnel. Her nameplate read "Miriam Thorne, Senior Clerk," and she looked up at me with the expression of someone accustomed to dealing with nervous newcomers.

"You must be Sora Ashworth," she said, consulting a ledger before I had even reached her desk. "We received word of your assignment yesterday. Records division, correct? Assistant archivist position?"

"Yes, ma'am." I handed over my letter of introduction, trying not to stare at the magical filing system behind her—sheets of parchment that sorted themselves into neat stacks while quills moved across their surfaces without human guidance. "I'm supposed to report to the Archives today."

Miriam scanned the letter with practiced efficiency, then stamped it with an approval seal that glowed briefly before fading. "Everything appears to be in order. The Archives are in Building C—that's the third structure to your left as you exit the main hall. Master Aldric will be expecting you. He's our head archivist, and while he can seem a bit gruff at first, he's fair and knowledgeable. Your living arrangements have been sorted—there's a dormitory for junior Guild personnel about ten minutes' walk from here."

She handed me a brass badge marked with my name and the Guild's symbol, along with a small leather folder containing what appeared to be maps, schedules, and various administrative forms. "Your badge will grant you access to the appropriate areas of the compound. The Archives, the common areas, the library, and your dormitory. As you advance in position, your access will expand accordingly."

The weight of the badge in my hand felt significant, like a key to a door I had never imagined walking through. "Thank you. Is there anything else I need to know before reporting to Master Aldric?"

"Mind your manners, keep accurate records, and don't touch anything without permission," Miriam said with a slight smile. "The Archives contain some rather valuable and occasionally dangerous materials. Oh, and lunch is served in the common hall from noon to two—I recommend the meat pies."

Building C proved to be a quieter, more scholarly structure than the main hall, its walls lined with enchanted sconces that provided steady, eye-friendly light. The air itself felt different here, charged with the subtle energy that accompanies the presence of many magical artifacts stored in close proximity. I could feel something stirring in the back of my mind—not quite my gift activating, but the potential for it, like the moment before lightning strikes.

Master Aldric's office occupied a corner of the building's second floor, accessible through a maze of corridors lined with carefully labeled doors: "Contract Archives—Years 847-852," "Monster Classification Records," "Magical Artifact Registry," and dozens of others. The man himself proved to be a elderly dwarf with steel-gray hair braided in the traditional style of his people and spectacles that I suspected were enhanced with some form of magnification magic.

"Sora Ashworth," he said without looking up from the document he was examining—a contract covered in amendments and corrections. "From Millbrook, apprenticed under village record-keepers, letter of recommendation from local law enforcement. Interesting credentials for an archivist position."

"I understand it's unusual," I began, but he waved me to silence.

"Unusual isn't necessarily bad. Too many of our junior archivists come straight from the Academy with heads full of theory and no practical experience with how records actually function in the real world." He finally looked up, studying me with eyes that were sharp despite his age. "Can you read?"

"Yes, sir. Several hands, actually."

"Write clearly and accurately under pressure?"

"I believe so."

"Handle confidential information with appropriate discretion?"

I thought of the silver ring, of the weight of secrets revealed and consequences faced. "Yes."

"Good. Then you'll do fine here. Your primary responsibilities will be intake and initial classification of contracts, maintenance of adventurer records, and assistance with artifact documentation as needed. The work isn't glamorous, but it's essential, and it will teach you more about how the Guild actually functions than any formal training program."

He led me through a series of rooms that housed the Guild's institutional memory. File cabinets stretched from floor to ceiling, their contents organized according to a system that seemed both logical and arcane. Some sections were clearly marked and easily accessible, while others bore warning labels about authorized personnel only. The magical filing systems I had glimpsed in the main hall were even more sophisticated here—entire walls of documents that could be summoned with a specific request, sorting themselves according to criteria that changed based on the searcher's needs.

"Most of your work will be with current contracts and recent mission reports," Master Aldric explained as we walked. "But don't neglect the historical records. Patterns repeat themselves in this business, and an archivist who understands the past can often predict future complications."

My assigned workspace proved to be a desk in a room shared with three other junior clerks, each focused intently on their own tasks. The woman closest to me looked up with a friendly smile as Master Aldric made introductions.

"This is Elena Brightquill," he said. "She'll help orient you to our daily procedures. Elena, Miss Ashworth will be handling intake classification starting tomorrow."

Elena was perhaps a few years older than me, with the ink-stained fingers and slightly rushed manner of someone perpetually managing too many tasks at once. Her workspace was notably more organized than those of her colleagues, her filing system a model of efficiency that impressed even Master Aldric.

"Welcome to the controlled chaos," she said once the head archivist had departed. "It looks overwhelming at first, but there's a rhythm to it once you understand how everything connects. Are you familiar with Guild ranking systems? Contract classifications? Monster threat assessments?"

"Only from stories and general knowledge," I admitted. "I'm hoping to learn quickly."

"You will. The work teaches you fast." She gestured toward the stack of documents on her desk. "Every piece of paper that comes through here tells a story. Contract requests from desperate villages, mission reports from teams that barely survived their assignments, equipment requisitions that hint at preparations for something big. After a while, you start to see the patterns."

As if summoned by her words, a Bronze-ranked adventurer appeared at our desk, looking harried and slightly desperate. He was young—perhaps my age or a year older—with the kind of practical gear that spoke of someone still building his reputation. His sword, I noticed immediately, was older than he was, its leather grip worn smooth by many hands.

"Excuse me," he said, addressing Elena but glancing uncertainly in my direction. "I'm Kael Ironwood, Bronze rank. I'm trying to track down information about a contract my father might have taken fifteen or twenty years ago. Something involving the ruins east of Millbrook."

Elena's expression immediately became more attentive. "That would be in the historical archives. Do you have any specifics? A contract number, approximate date, names of other team members?"

Kael's frustration was evident. "That's the problem. I don't have much to go on. My father died when I was young, and my mother doesn't like talking about his adventuring days. But I found some of his old gear, and there are details that don't match up with the stories I was told."

Something about his situation resonated with me—the sense of secrets hidden, of stories that didn't align with official versions. I found myself speaking before I had fully considered the implications. "What kind of details?"

He looked at me uncertainly. "I'm sorry, I don't know if I should be discussing this with someone I just met."

"Sora is starting work here today," Elena explained. "She'll be handling intake and classification, so she'll be seeing plenty of confidential information. And honestly, historical research isn't really my specialty."

Kael seemed to weigh his options, then made a decision. "My father was supposedly killed in a routine dungeon clearing—low-risk, standard Bronze-rank contract. But his sword has damage patterns that don't match that kind of mission. Scorch marks from high-level fire magic, nicks that look like they came from weapons much more sophisticated than goblin blades. And there's something else." He hesitated, then continued. "There are scratches on the pommel that might be intentional markings. Like someone was trying to leave a record of something."

The mention of markings that might be intentional records made my pulse quicken. "Have you tried touching the sword? Sometimes old weapons retain... impressions of significant events."

Both Elena and Kael stared at me, and I realized I might have revealed more about my capabilities than was wise. Elena's expression was particularly thoughtful, as if she was reassessing something about me.

"I mean," I added quickly, "some people have sensitivity to magical residues. If the sword was involved in a particularly traumatic event, it might have retained some trace of that experience."

"That's... actually not uncommon," Elena said slowly. "Some of our senior archivists have minor divination gifts that help with authentication and historical research. It's considered a valuable skill in this line of work."

Kael looked between us with growing interest. "Would you be willing to take a look? I mean, if you have that kind of ability? I've been trying to piece this together for months, and the official records are either sealed or incomplete."

The responsible answer would have been to decline, to refer him to more senior personnel, to follow proper procedures for handling requests from Guild members. Instead, I heard myself saying, "I could try. But I should warn you—if there are strong emotional impressions attached to the sword, the experience might be... intense."

"I need to know," he said simply. "Whatever happened to him, whatever he was really involved in, I need to understand."

Elena looked around the office, then made a decision. "Conference room three is empty right now. We could use it for a few minutes if you want privacy for this."

The conference room was small but comfortable, designed for meetings between Guild personnel and clients. Kael placed his father's sword on the polished wooden table with obvious reverence. Up close, I could see that the weapon was indeed much older and more sophisticated than typical Bronze-rank gear. The blade showed signs of expert maintenance despite the damage patterns Kael had mentioned, and the grip was wrapped in a style that had been popular decades earlier.

"Before I try this," I said, "I should explain what might happen. If your father's sword retained emotional impressions from whatever happened to him, I'll experience those emotions as if they were my own. That means if he was afraid, I'll feel that fear. If he was in pain, I'll feel echoes of that pain. And I'll likely see fragments of his memories from the time the impressions were formed."

Kael nodded grimly. "I understand. And I appreciate the warning."

I took a deep breath, centering myself the way Mother had taught me, and placed my hands on the sword's grip. The response was immediate and overwhelming.

*Fear. Not the clean fear of facing a known enemy, but the sick dread of realizing you've been betrayed. Marcus Ironwood—and I knew that was his name now, could feel his identity resonating through the weapon—crouched behind a crumbling stone wall while his teammates' voices echoed from the chamber ahead. They were supposed to be clearing undead from an abandoned shrine, a routine Bronze-rank contract worth a few silver pieces and some modest reputation.*

*But the voices he was hearing weren't discussing undead. They were arguing about payment, about silence, about making sure "no one asks questions about what we found here." One voice belonged to Thomas Graystone, the Silver-rank adventurer who had recruited Marcus for this mission. The other was unfamiliar, cultured and cold in a way that made Marcus's skin crawl.*

*"The boy is a liability," the unknown voice said. "He's too honest, too likely to report what he's seen. Better to end this now and report it as a dungeon accident."*

*"Marcus has a wife and son," Thomas protested, though his voice lacked conviction. "There has to be another way."*

*"There is no other way. Not if you want to collect the rest of your payment."*

*Marcus gripped his sword tighter, trying to process what he was hearing. The shrine wasn't abandoned—it was being used for something, something important enough to kill witnesses over. He had to get out, had to warn someone, had to—*

*The attack came from behind, a surge of fire magic that should have killed him instantly. Only his warrior's instincts saved him, throwing him aside at the last moment. His sword caught some of the blast, the metal heating to nearly unbearable temperatures, but he managed to keep his grip. Thomas emerged from the chamber ahead, his face twisted with guilt and resignation.*

*"I'm sorry, Marcus," he said, drawing his own weapon. "I'm truly sorry."*

The vision fragmented there, dissolving into pain and darkness and a last desperate thought: *Someone has to know. Someone has to remember.*

I jerked my hands back from the sword, gasping and shaking from the intensity of the experience. Elena was immediately at my side with a glass of water, while Kael watched with an expression of terrible understanding.

"He was murdered," I said once I could speak clearly. "It wasn't a dungeon accident. He discovered something he wasn't supposed to see, and they killed him to keep him quiet."

Kael's face went white, then red with anger. "I knew it. I knew the official story was wrong." He paused, processing the implications. "You said 'they.' Who else was involved?"

"Someone named Thomas Graystone, and at least one other person whose voice I didn't recognize. Thomas seemed reluctant, but he went along with it. The other person was clearly in charge, offering payment for your father's death."

Elena had been listening intently, and now she spoke with careful precision. "Thomas Graystone. I know that name. He retired from active adventuring about fifteen years ago, around the time this would have happened. He's been working as a Guild assessor since then, evaluating new members and reviewing contract classifications."

The implications of that hung in the air like a poisonous cloud. If Thomas Graystone had been involved in Marcus Ironwood's murder, his position within the Guild gave him access to records, the ability to influence investigations, the power to ensure that certain questions were never asked.

"We need to be careful about how we proceed," I said, thinking of my own recent experience with revealing dangerous truths. "If Graystone is still connected to whoever ordered your father's death, approaching this directly could be dangerous."

Kael's jaw tightened with determination. "I don't care about the danger. My father died trying to expose something corrupt, and I won't let that be for nothing."

"I understand," I said gently. "But getting yourself killed won't honor his memory either. We need evidence, documentation, a way to prove what happened that can't be dismissed or covered up."

Elena nodded thoughtfully. "The Archives might have more information than you realize. If there was a cover-up, there might be traces of it in the records—amended contracts, unusual payment authorizations, personnel changes that coincided with your father's death. It would take time to find, but..."

"I have time," Kael said immediately. "And if you're willing to help, I can make it worth your while. I've been saving every copper from my contracts, hoping to eventually afford a proper investigation."

"It's not about payment," I said, surprising myself with the certainty in my voice. "Your father died because he wouldn't stay silent about something wrong. That matters. Truth matters."

As we prepared to leave the conference room, Elena caught my arm gently. "Sora, what you just did—that level of divination ability is rare. And valuable. You might want to consider having it formally assessed and added to your Guild record."

I thought about my mother's warnings, about the price of being different, about the way my village had looked at me after the truth about Elder Matthias came out. "I prefer to keep it quiet for now. Is that possible?"

"Of course. But don't underestimate yourself. The Guild needs people who can see past the official versions of events, who can uncover truths that others miss or choose to ignore."

That evening, as I settled into my small but comfortable room in the junior personnel dormitory, I reflected on how much my life had changed in just a few weeks. From village seamstress's daughter to Guild archivist, from hiding my gift to using it to help someone seek justice for their murdered father. The brass badge on my bedside table caught the light from the magical sconces, its weight a constant reminder that I was no longer just Sora from Millbrook.

I was Sora Ashworth, Guild archivist, keeper of records and seeker of hidden truths. And tomorrow, I would begin the work of uncovering exactly what Marcus Ironwood had died trying to reveal.

The adventure, I realized, was just beginning.
