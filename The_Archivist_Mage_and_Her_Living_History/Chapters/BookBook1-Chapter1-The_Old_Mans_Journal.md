The ledger slipped from my fingers and hit the floor with a dull thud that seemed to echo through the entire Victoria Guild archives. I winced, not from the noise, but from the sudden rush of magical residue that flooded through me as my bare palm touched the aged leather binding. Three years since I'd arrived in this city, and I still hadn't learned to keep my gloves on at all times.

"Careful with those, Remniel," Master Aldric called from somewhere between the towering shelves. "Some of those records are older than the building itself."

"Sorry, Master Aldric," I called back, pulling on my cotton gloves with practiced haste. The echoes from the ledger still danced at the edges of my consciousness—fragments of a merchant's anxiety over grain prices from decades past, the faint impression of ink-stained fingers, and beneath it all, something else. Something that made my chest tighten with a familiar ache.

The leather had remembered being new once, had remembered the pride of the clerk who'd first cracked its spine to record the guild's business. That clerk had been young, eager, certain that their work mattered. I wondered if they'd ended up like me, filing reports in the basement archives, making tea for senior members who couldn't quite remember my name.

I tucked the ledger under my arm and continued my rounds, checking items against the morning's inventory list. The archives stretched out in all directions, a maze of knowledge that smelled perpetually of old paper and the lavender sachets we tucked between volumes to keep the moths away. Most junior clerks complained about archive duty, but I'd grown to appreciate the solitude. Down here, no one watched me too closely, no one asked uncomfortable questions about where I'd come from or why a nineteen-year-old with no apparent connections had been hired at all.

The confiscation vault waited at the end of the third row, its iron door standing open for the weekly cataloging. Inside, wooden shelves held the detritus of minor crimes and civil disputes—unclaimed evidence, seized contraband, items of disputed ownership. Most of it was mundane: pouches of questionable herbs, weighted dice, bottles of unlicensed potions that probably did nothing more than cause mild indigestion. But occasionally, something interesting found its way into the collection.

Today's additions sat in a basket near the door. I settled cross-legged on the floor with my ledger and began the tedious process of recording each item. A brass compass that spun wildly no matter which direction you faced—probably magnetized as a prank. A set of seven painted stones that claimed to tell fortunes but were clearly just river rocks with amateur symbols. A torn silk scarf that had probably been evidence in a pickpocketing case.

And then, at the bottom of the basket, wrapped in brown paper that crumbled at my touch, lay a silver locket.

Even through my gloves, I could feel it calling to me. Not in the way magical artifacts usually did, with their sharp, intentional enchantments. This was different. This was the slow accumulation of human emotion worn into metal through years of touch, the kind of residue that most people never noticed but that sang to me like a forgotten song.

I shouldn't have taken off my gloves. I knew better. But my hands moved of their own accord, peeling away the cotton barriers between my skin and the locket's tarnished surface.

The world exploded into rain.

Not the gentle spring showers that graced Victoria's gardens, but a torrential downpour that turned the world into a grey blur. I stood—no, she stood—on a train platform that I recognized as Victoria's old eastern station, the one they'd torn down five years ago to build the new commercial district. Water streamed from the brim of a hat pulled low, and trembling fingers clutched the locket against a wool coat that did nothing to stop the shaking.

"Please," a voice said, and I couldn't tell if it came from the woman holding the locket or the man standing before her. "Please don't ask me to wait."

"Six months," he said, and his voice cracked like a boy's though his hands were steady as they closed over hers, pressing the locket deeper into her palm. "Six months and I'll have enough saved. We can leave together. Start fresh somewhere no one knows us."

"Your family—"

"Doesn't matter. Nothing matters but this." He lifted her chin, and through the rain I saw a face that might have been handsome if it weren't so young, so desperate. "Promise me you'll wait."

The train whistle shrieked, and the vision shattered.

I gasped, finding myself back on the cold floor of the confiscation vault, the locket burning cold against my palm. My heart raced with borrowed grief, borrowed hope, borrowed betrayal. Because there was more, layered beneath that first memory like sediment in a riverbed. Years of waiting. Years of the locket being touched, opened, closed, kissed in secret moments when no one was watching. Years of promises rotting like fruit left too long in the sun.

The locket had never been claimed. He'd never come back.

I forced myself to breathe slowly, to separate my emotions from the echo of hers. This was always the hardest part—remembering that these weren't my memories, wasn't my pain. The woman in the rain had loved someone who'd asked her to wait, and she'd waited long past the point of reason. The locket knew her fingers better than any other touch. It had absorbed her hope, her doubt, her gradual resignation.

But there was something else, a newer layer of memory that made me frown. The locket hadn't come here through normal channels. It had been confiscated just three days ago from a pawnshop in the Copper District, flagged as potentially stolen goods. The report would have details—names, addresses, circumstances.

I shouldn't care. This was exactly the kind of thing that had gotten me exiled from my village in the first place. Other people's secrets weren't mine to uncover, their pain wasn't mine to witness. The guild had hired me to file papers and organize evidence, not to chase down old ghosts.

But my hands were already reaching for the report ledger, flipping to three days ago. The entry was brief: "Silver locket, engraved with initials E.M., seized from Hendrick's Pawnshop pending ownership verification. Claimed as collateral by one Mrs. Eleanor Marsh, disputed by shop owner."

Eleanor Marsh. E.M. The initials on the locket suddenly felt heavier in my hand.

She was still alive. Still in the city.

I closed the ledger carefully, my mind racing. Guild protocol was clear—confiscated items remained in storage until legal ownership could be established through proper documentation. The process could take months, sometimes years. By then, Mrs. Marsh might be gone, might never know that her locket had been found.

The rational part of my mind, the part that had learned hard lessons about the price of revealing unwanted truths, told me to catalog the locket and forget about it. File it away with all the other broken promises and lost chances that gathered dust in this vault. That was my job. That was why I was safe here, invisible here. Because I'd learned to keep my mouth shut and my hands gloved.

But I could still feel the rain on her face. Still feel the weight of years spent waiting for someone who never came back.

"Finding everything you need?"

I nearly jumped out of my skin. Master Aldric stood in the vault doorway, his perpetually ink-stained fingers wrapped around a steaming mug of tea. He was a thin man in his fifties, with the kind of distracted air that made you think he was never quite looking at you even when his eyes were directly on your face.

"Yes, Master Aldric," I managed, slipping the locket back into its brown paper wrapping. "Just cataloging the new arrivals."

He hummed noncommittally, taking a sip of his tea. "Don't forget to cross-reference with the seizure reports. New regulations from upstairs. Everything needs to be triple-documented now."

"Of course."

He lingered for a moment longer, and I had the unsettling feeling he was actually seeing me for once. "You know, Remniel, you're quite good at this work. Thorough. Careful. Not many junior clerks would willingly spend so much time in the archives."

"I like the quiet," I said truthfully.

"Hmm." Another sip of tea. "Well, don't like it too much. The guild values ambitious members, not just careful ones. Consider requesting a transfer to active cases once you've put in your year here. Might do you good to see how the paperwork connects to the real world."

He wandered off before I could respond, leaving me alone with the locket and the weight of my decision. The guild valued ambition, he'd said. But what they really valued was order, protocol, the smooth functioning of systems that had been in place for generations. They didn't value junior clerks who went around returning lost items to widows based on magical impressions that couldn't be properly documented or verified.

And yet.

I pulled out my personal notebook, the one I used to track my own observations rather than official guild business. In it, I sketched the locket quickly—the tarnished silver surface, the delicate engraving, the way the chain had worn thin in places from constant handling. Below the sketch, I wrote: "Eleanor Marsh, Copper District. Pawnshop dispute. Rain memory, eastern station. Someone who never came back."

It wasn't much, but it was a start. The widow deserved to have her locket back, deserved to know it had been found. The question was how to make that happen without revealing my involvement, without admitting that I'd used my magic to uncover what no normal investigation would have found.

I spent the rest of the morning finishing the cataloging, my mind only half on the task. Every item I touched whispered its own story, but none called to me the way the locket had. By lunch, I'd developed something resembling a plan. It wasn't a good plan, but it was better than doing nothing.

The Copper District was only a twenty-minute walk from the guild. I could go during my lunch break, scope out the pawnshop, maybe learn more
