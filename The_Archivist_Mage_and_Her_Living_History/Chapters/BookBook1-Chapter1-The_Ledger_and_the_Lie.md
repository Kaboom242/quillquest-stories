The ledger smelled like mildew and disappointment. I wrinkled my nose as I lifted another stack of yellowed records from the storage chest, trying not to sneeze at the dust that plumed into the afternoon sunlight streaming through the village hall's narrow windows. Around me, the other volunteers chatted about harvest decorations and who would win the pie contest at tomorrow's festival. Their voices felt distant, muffled by the weight of old paper and older secrets.

"Sora, dear, could you sort those by year?" Mrs. Elmsworth called from across the room, her arms full of faded festival banners. "We're trying to find the original charter for the founding ceremony recreation."

I nodded, already separating the documents into neat piles. My fingers moved with practiced efficiency, a skill honed by years of helping my mother with her seamstress accounts. The leather-bound volumes felt rough against my skin, their covers cracked with age. Most bore dates from decades past, back when our village of Millhaven was little more than a trading post on the road to Glyphmere.

The burn started as a tingle, like touching metal in winter. I'd reached for a particularly thick ledger, its green binding faded to the color of old moss, when the sensation raced up my arm. The world tilted sideways, colors bleeding at the edges of my vision, and suddenly I wasn't in the dusty storage room anymore.

Rain hammered against wooden shutters. The same room, but different. Newer. A man in merchant's clothes stood before the desk, water dripping from his cloak onto the floor I'd just helped sweep. His hands trembled as he pushed a leather pouch across the polished wood surface. The clink of coins echoed like thunder.

"The bridge inspection reports," he said, his voice thin with desperation. "You'll sign them? Say the supports are sound?"

Elder Matthias sat behind the desk, though he looked younger, his hair still peppered with brown instead of completely silver. His fingers drummed against the ledger I now held, the same nervous rhythm I'd seen him tap during town meetings. "The merchants' guild won't wait much longer for the new trade route. If we delay the inspection..."

"People could die if that bridge fails." The merchant's voice cracked. "My own wagons use that crossing."

"Then perhaps you should have thought of that before skimping on materials." Matthias pulled the pouch toward him, weighing it in his palm. "The inspection passes. The festival proceeds. The trade route opens. Everyone prospers."

The vision shattered like dropped glass. I gasped, the ledger tumbling from my hands onto the floor with a bang that made everyone turn. My knees hit the floorboards hard, and I pressed my palms against the cool wood, trying to stop the room from spinning.

"Sora!" Mrs. Elmsworth rushed over, her festival banners forgotten. "Are you alright? You've gone pale as milk."

"I'm... I'm fine." The lie tasted bitter. My stomach churned with borrowed guilt, the merchant's fear still clinging to my thoughts like cobwebs. "Just stood up too fast."

She helped me to my feet, clucking her tongue. "You young people, skipping meals to stay thin. There's water in the kitchen. Go sit for a moment."

I nodded, grateful for the excuse to leave. But my eyes found Elder Matthias across the room, where he supervised the hanging of a ceremonial tapestry. He must have felt my stare because he turned, his weathered face creasing into a concerned smile. The same smile he'd worn in the echo while taking a bribe that could have killed dozens.

The kitchen was mercifully empty. I splashed cold water on my face, watching it drip into the basin as I tried to make sense of what I'd seen. This wasn't the first time I'd experienced these visions, these echoes of emotion and memory that clung to objects like morning dew. But they'd always been small things before. A child's joy on a favorite toy. A lover's longing on a gifted scarf. Never something like this. Never something that mattered.

I returned to the main hall, moving mechanically through the motions of sorting and organizing. But my thoughts kept circling back to that leather pouch, heavy with coin and heavier with consequence. The Silverbrook Bridge had been rebuilt five years ago after a catastrophic collapse during spring flooding. Three merchants had died, their wagons swept away by the raging waters. The investigation had blamed unusual rainfall and age, but what if...

"Elder Matthias," I found myself saying, my voice steady despite the hammering of my heart. "I was wondering about these old inspection records. For the festival display about village history."

He approached, his boots clicking against the floor with measured authority. Up close, I could see the lines around his eyes, the weight of years and decisions etched into his skin. "What about them, young Sora?"

"The Silverbrook Bridge." I held up the green ledger, watching his face carefully. "The dates are interesting. It says here the last inspection before the collapse was signed off as completely sound, but then it failed just months later."

His smile never wavered, but something flickered in his eyes. Recognition, maybe. Or warning. "Tragic business, that. But sometimes nature surprises us all. The gods test us with such trials."

"The gods," I repeated softly. "Or men's choices?"

The hall had gone quiet around us. I could feel the weight of attention, volunteers pausing in their work to watch our strange confrontation. Mrs. Elmsworth's hands stilled on her banners. The young men hanging garlands from the rafters stopped their hammering.

Elder Matthias leaned closer, his voice dropping

Elder Matthias leaned closer, his voice dropping to barely above a whisper. "Careful, child. Old papers can be misleading. Memory plays tricks, and documents don't always tell the whole story." His weathered hand reached for the ledger, but I pulled it back instinctively, clutching it against my chest.

"Perhaps we should review these records together," he suggested, louder now, addressing the room as much as me. "For historical accuracy, of course. We wouldn't want to present incorrect information at the festival."

The weight of his authority pressed down on me like a physical thing. This was Elder Matthias, who had led our village council for twenty years. Who had overseen the expansion of the market square and negotiated the trade agreements that kept Millhaven prosperous. Who attended every birth celebration and spoke at every funeral. The man who had shaped the very fabric of our community stood before me, and I was just the seamstress's daughter, barely past my eighteenth winter.

But I could still feel the merchant's terror echoing in my bones, could still hear the clink of those coins that had bought silence at the cost of lives.

"I think the records are quite clear," I said, surprised by the steadiness in my voice. "The inspection was signed. The bridge was declared sound. And then it wasn't."

A murmur rippled through the hall. Elder Matthias's jaw tightened, the grandfather's mask slipping for just a moment to reveal something harder underneath. "Young lady, grief can make us seek someone to blame for tragedies that have no villain. Those merchants who died were good people. Their families have suffered enough without dragging their memory through baseless speculation."

The calculated cruelty of invoking the dead families made my stomach turn. He was using their grief as a shield, knowing that challenging him meant appearing to dishonor the victims. But as I stood there, the ledger warm against my chest, another echo pulsed through me. Fainter this time, like looking through frosted glass.

A woman crying. A child's wagon, abandoned by the riverbank. The same merchant from the first vision, standing at the bridge days before the collapse, running his hands along support beams that were already beginning to crack. His face pale with the knowledge of what he'd allowed to happen.

"You're right," I said quietly. "They were good people. Thomas Brightwater, who sold the finest cloth in three villages. Marcus Irondale, the blacksmith's cousin. Young Felix Morrow, barely married a year." I recited their names like a prayer, watching the color drain from Elder Matthias's face. "Good people who trusted that when village officials declared a bridge safe, it was safe."

The silence in the hall had weight now, pressing against the walls like water against a dam. Mrs. Elmsworth set down her banners with deliberate care. The young men on the ladders had descended, forming a loose circle of witnesses. Even the dust motes seemed to pause in their lazy drift through the sunbeams.

"What are you suggesting?" Elder Matthias asked, his voice dangerously soft.

"I'm not suggesting anything." I opened the ledger, running my finger along the faded ink of the inspection record. "But I am wondering why this signature looks so different from the inspector's other documents. And why there's a deposit in the village treasury the very next day, marked only as 'anonymous donation for festival improvements.'"

It was a guess, but his flinch told me I'd struck true. The echoes from objects weren't always complete, but they gave me enough to piece together the shape of the truth. And the truth had a way of recognizing itself when spoken aloud.

"You don't know what you're playing with, girl." The grandfather's warmth had completely disappeared from his voice now. "The village survived because of decisions I made. Trade routes were established. Prosperity was secured. Sometimes leadership requires difficult choices."

"Choices that killed three people."

"Choices that saved dozens more from poverty when the trade route opened!" He slammed his hand on a nearby table, making everyone jump. "Do you think maintaining a village is simple? Do you think it's all harvest festivals and pie contests? That bridge would have been inspected eventually. The flooding was unprecedented. No one could have predicted—"

"You could have." The words came out barely louder than a breath, but they cut through his justification like a blade. "The merchant who bribed you knew the bridge was failing. He came to you because he'd used substandard materials and needed time to move his assets before the truth came out. And you took his money."

Elder Matthias's face had gone the color of old parchment. Around us, the volunteers stood frozen, as if afraid that moving might shatter something irreparable. The afternoon sun had shifted, casting long shadows across the floor like accusatory fingers.

"You have no proof," he said finally. "Only old papers and wild accusations."

He was right, of course. I had no proof that would stand before a magistrate. The visions that haunted me weren't evidence. They were ghosts of emotion, echoes of truth that only I could hear. But sometimes, truth didn't need a courtroom to find its justice.

"No," I agreed. "I have no proof. But I have questions. And I think the families of those who died deserve answers." I turned to address the room, meeting the eyes of my neighbors one by one. "Don't they deserve to know why the inspection records don't match? Why the treasury shows a mysterious donation? Why Elder Matthias is so eager to dismiss concerns about documents he claims are meaningless?"

Mrs. Elmsworth stepped forward, her usual cheerfulness replaced by something stern and purposeful. "I lost my nephew in that collapse," she said quietly. "Marcus was bringing supplies for my shop. I was told it was an act of nature. Unavoidable." She looked at Elder Matthias, and I saw years of suppressed suspicion crystallizing into certainty. "But I always wondered why you pushed so hard against the memorial stone. Why you insisted we should 'move forward' so quickly."

Others began to speak then, voices overlapping as long-buried doubts found air. The baker mentioned odd discrepancies in shipping records. The stableman recalled seeing the merchant who'd overseen the bridge construction leaving the village in haste days before the collapse. Each small observation was meaningless alone, but together they wove a tapestry of complicity that couldn't be ignored.

Elder Matthias stood in the center of it all, his authority crumbling like old mortar. He looked older suddenly, the weight of his secret finally showing on his shoulders. When he spoke again, his voice carried the exhaustion of a man who'd been running from
