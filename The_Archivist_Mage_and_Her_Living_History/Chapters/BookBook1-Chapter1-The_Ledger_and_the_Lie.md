The ledger smelled like mildew and disappointment. I wrinkled my nose as I lifted another stack of yellowed records from the storage chest, trying not to sneeze at the dust that plumed into the afternoon sunlight streaming through the village hall's narrow windows. Around me, the other volunteers chatted about harvest decorations and who would win the pie contest at tomorrow's festival. Their voices felt distant, muffled by the weight of old paper and older secrets.

"Sora, dear, could you sort those by year?" Mrs. Elmsworth called from across the room, her arms full of faded festival banners. "We're trying to find the original charter for the founding ceremony recreation."

I nodded, already separating the documents into neat piles. My fingers moved with practiced efficiency, a skill honed by years of helping my mother with her seamstress accounts. The leather-bound volumes felt rough against my skin, their covers cracked with age. Most bore dates from decades past, back when our village of Millhaven was little more than a trading post on the road to Glyphmere.

The burn started as a tingle, like touching metal in winter. I'd reached for a particularly thick ledger, its green binding faded to the color of old moss, when the sensation raced up my arm. The world tilted sideways, colors bleeding at the edges of my vision, and suddenly I wasn't in the dusty storage room anymore.

Rain hammered against wooden shutters. The same room, but different. Newer. A man in merchant's clothes stood before the desk, water dripping from his cloak onto the floor I'd just helped sweep. His hands trembled as he pushed a leather pouch across the polished wood surface. The clink of coins echoed like thunder.

"The bridge inspection reports," he said, his voice thin with desperation. "You'll sign them? Say the supports are sound?"

Elder Matthias sat behind the desk, though he looked younger, his hair still peppered with brown instead of completely silver. His fingers drummed against the ledger I now held, the same nervous rhythm I'd seen him tap during town meetings. "The merchants' guild won't wait much longer for the new trade route. If we delay the inspection..."

"People could die if that bridge fails." The merchant's voice cracked. "My own wagons use that crossing."

"Then perhaps you should have thought of that before skimping on materials." Matthias pulled the pouch toward him, weighing it in his palm. "The inspection passes. The festival proceeds. The trade route opens. Everyone prospers."

The vision shattered like dropped glass. I gasped, the ledger tumbling from my hands onto the floor with a bang that made everyone turn. My knees hit the floorboards hard, and I pressed my palms against the cool wood, trying to stop the room from spinning.

"Sora!" Mrs. Elmsworth rushed over, her festival banners forgotten. "Are you alright? You've gone pale as milk."

"I'm... I'm fine." The lie tasted bitter. My stomach churned with borrowed guilt, the merchant's fear still clinging to my thoughts like cobwebs. "Just stood up too fast."

She helped me to my feet, clucking her tongue. "You young people, skipping meals to stay thin. There's water in the kitchen. Go sit for a moment."

I nodded, grateful for the excuse to leave. But my eyes found Elder Matthias across the room, where he supervised the hanging of a ceremonial tapestry. He must have felt my stare because he turned, his weathered face creasing into a concerned smile. The same smile he'd worn in the echo while taking a bribe that could have killed dozens.

The kitchen was mercifully empty. I splashed cold water on my face, watching it drip into the basin as I tried to make sense of what I'd seen. This wasn't the first time I'd experienced these visions, these echoes of emotion and memory that clung to objects like morning dew. But they'd always been small things before. A child's joy on a favorite toy. A lover's longing on a gifted scarf. Never something like this. Never something that mattered.

I returned to the main hall, moving mechanically through the motions of sorting and organizing. But my thoughts kept circling back to that leather pouch, heavy with coin and heavier with consequence. The Silverbrook Bridge had been rebuilt five years ago after a catastrophic collapse during spring flooding. Three merchants had died, their wagons swept away by the raging waters. The investigation had blamed unusual rainfall and age, but what if...

"Elder Matthias," I found myself saying, my voice steady despite the hammering of my heart. "I was wondering about these old inspection records. For the festival display about village history."

He approached, his boots clicking against the floor with measured authority. Up close, I could see the lines around his eyes, the weight of years and decisions etched into his skin. "What about them, young Sora?"

"The Silverbrook Bridge." I held up the green ledger, watching his face carefully. "The dates are interesting. It says here the last inspection before the collapse was signed off as completely sound, but then it failed just months later."

His smile never wavered, but something flickered in his eyes. Recognition, maybe. Or warning. "Tragic business, that. But sometimes nature surprises us all. The gods test us with such trials."

"The gods," I repeated softly. "Or men's choices?"

The hall had gone quiet around us. I could feel the weight of attention, volunteers pausing in their work to watch our strange confrontation. Mrs. Elmsworth's hands stilled on her banners. The young men hanging garlands from the rafters stopped their hammering.

Elder Matthias leaned closer, his voice dropping
