The ledger smelled like mildew and disappointment. I wrinkled my nose as I lifted another stack of yellowed records from the storage chest, trying not to sneeze at the dust that plumed into the afternoon sunlight streaming through the village hall's narrow windows. Around me, the other volunteers chatted about harvest decorations and who would win the pie contest at tomorrow's festival. Their voices felt distant, muffled by the weight of old paper and older secrets.

"Sora, dear, could you sort those by year?" Mrs. Elmsworth called from across the room, her arms full of faded festival banners. "We're trying to find the original charter for the founding ceremony recreation."

I nodded, already separating the documents into neat piles. My fingers moved with practiced efficiency, a skill honed by years of helping my mother with her seamstress accounts. The leather-bound volumes felt rough against my skin, their covers cracked with age. Most bore dates from decades past, back when our village of Millhaven was little more than a trading post on the road to Glyphmere.

The burn started as a tingle, like touching metal in winter. I'd reached for a particularly thick ledger, its green binding faded to the color of old moss, when the sensation raced up my arm. The world tilted sideways, colors bleeding at the edges of my vision, and suddenly I wasn't in the dusty storage room anymore.

Rain hammered against wooden shutters. The same room, but different. Newer. A man in merchant's clothes stood before the desk, water dripping from his cloak onto the floor I'd just helped sweep. His hands trembled as he pushed a leather pouch across the polished wood surface. The clink of coins echoed like thunder.

"The bridge inspection reports," he said, his voice thin with desperation. "You'll sign them? Say the supports are sound?"

Elder Matthias sat behind the desk, though he looked younger, his hair still peppered with brown instead of completely silver. His fingers drummed against the ledger I now held, the same nervous rhythm I'd seen him tap during town meetings. "The merchants' guild won't wait much longer for the new trade route. If we delay the inspection..."

"People could die if that bridge fails." The merchant's voice cracked. "My own wagons use that crossing."

"Then perhaps you should have thought of that before skimping on materials." Matthias pulled the pouch toward him, weighing it in his palm. "The inspection passes. The festival proceeds. The trade route opens. Everyone prospers."

The vision shattered like dropped glass. I gasped, the ledger tumbling from my hands onto the floor with a bang that made everyone turn. My knees hit the floorboards hard, and I pressed my palms against the cool wood, trying to stop the room from spinning.

"Sora!" Mrs. Elmsworth rushed over, her festival banners forgotten. "Are you alright? You've gone pale as milk."

"I'm... I'm fine." The lie tasted bitter. My stomach churned with borrowed guilt, the merchant's fear still clinging to my thoughts like cobwebs. "Just stood up too fast."

She helped me to my feet, clucking her tongue. "You young people, skipping meals to stay thin. There's water in the kitchen. Go sit for a moment."

I nodded, grateful for the excuse to leave. But my eyes found Elder Matthias across the room, where he supervised the hanging of a ceremonial tapestry. He must have felt my stare because he turned, his weathered face creasing into a concerned smile. The same smile he'd worn in the echo while taking a bribe that could have killed dozens.

The kitchen was mercifully empty. I splashed cold water on my face, watching it drip into the basin as I tried to make sense of what I'd seen. This wasn't the first time I'd experienced these visions, these echoes of emotion and memory that clung to objects like morning dew. But they'd always been small things before. A child's joy on a favorite toy. A lover's longing on a gifted scarf. Never something like this. Never something that mattered.

I returned to the main hall, moving mechanically through the motions of sorting and organizing. But my thoughts kept circling back to that leather pouch, heavy with coin and heavier with consequence. The Silverbrook Bridge had been rebuilt five years ago after a catastrophic collapse during spring flooding. Three merchants had died, their wagons swept away by the raging waters. The investigation had blamed unusual rainfall and age, but what if...

"Elder Matthias," I found myself saying, my voice steady despite the hammering of my heart. "I was wondering about these old inspection records. For the festival display about village history."

He approached, his boots clicking against the floor with measured authority. Up close, I could see the lines around his eyes, the weight of years and decisions etched into his skin. "What about them, young Sora?"

"The Silverbrook Bridge." I held up the green ledger, watching his face carefully. "The dates are interesting. It says here the last inspection before the collapse was signed off as completely sound, but then it failed just months later."

His smile never wavered, but something flickered in his eyes. Recognition, maybe. Or warning. "Tragic business, that. But sometimes nature surprises us all. The gods test us with such trials."

"The gods," I repeated softly. "Or men's choices?"

The hall had gone quiet around us. I could feel the weight of attention, volunteers pausing in their work to watch our strange confrontation. Mrs. Elmsworth's hands stilled on her banners. The young men hanging garlands from the rafters stopped their hammering.

Elder Matthias leaned closer, his voice dropping

Elder Matthias leaned closer, his voice dropping to barely above a whisper. "Careful, child. Old papers can be misleading. Memory plays tricks, and documents don't always tell the whole story." His weathered hand reached for the ledger, but I pulled it back instinctively, clutching it against my chest.

"Perhaps we should review these records together," he suggested, louder now, addressing the room as much as me. "For historical accuracy, of course. We wouldn't want to present incorrect information at the festival."

The weight of his authority pressed down on me like a physical thing. This was Elder Matthias, who had led our village council for twenty years. Who had overseen the expansion of the market square and negotiated the trade agreements that kept Millhaven prosperous. Who attended every birth celebration and spoke at every funeral. The man who had shaped the very fabric of our community stood before me, and I was just the seamstress's daughter, barely past my eighteenth winter.

But I could still feel the merchant's terror echoing in my bones, could still hear the clink of those coins that had bought silence at the cost of lives.

"I think the records are quite clear," I said, surprised by the steadiness in my voice. "The inspection was signed. The bridge was declared sound. And then it wasn't."

A murmur rippled through the hall. Elder Matthias's jaw tightened, the grandfather's mask slipping for just a moment to reveal something harder underneath. "Young lady, grief can make us seek someone to blame for tragedies that have no villain. Those merchants who died were good people. Their families have suffered enough without dragging their memory through baseless speculation."

The calculated cruelty of invoking the dead families made my stomach turn. He was using their grief as a shield, knowing that challenging him meant appearing to dishonor the victims. But as I stood there, the ledger warm against my chest, another echo pulsed through me. Fainter this time, like looking through frosted glass.

A woman crying. A child's wagon, abandoned by the riverbank. The same merchant from the first vision, standing at the bridge days before the collapse, running his hands along support beams that were already beginning to crack. His face pale with the knowledge of what he'd allowed to happen.

"You're right," I said quietly. "They were good people. Thomas Brightwater, who sold the finest cloth in three villages. Marcus Irondale, the blacksmith's cousin. Young Felix Morrow, barely married a year." I recited their names like a prayer, watching the color drain from Elder Matthias's face. "Good people who trusted that when village officials declared a bridge safe, it was safe."

The silence in the hall had weight now, pressing against the walls like water against a dam. Mrs. Elmsworth set down her banners with deliberate care. The young men on the ladders had descended, forming a loose circle of witnesses. Even the dust motes seemed to pause in their lazy drift through the sunbeams.

"What are you suggesting?" Elder Matthias asked, his voice dangerously soft.

"I'm not suggesting anything." I opened the ledger, running my finger along the faded ink of the inspection record. "But I am wondering why this signature looks so different from the inspector's other documents. And why there's a deposit in the village treasury the very next day, marked only as 'anonymous donation for festival improvements.'"

It was a guess, but his flinch told me I'd struck true. The echoes from objects weren't always complete, but they gave me enough to piece together the shape of the truth. And the truth had a way of recognizing itself when spoken aloud.

"You don't know what you're playing with, girl." The grandfather's warmth had completely disappeared from his voice now. "The village survived because of decisions I made. Trade routes were established. Prosperity was secured. Sometimes leadership requires difficult choices."

"Choices that killed three people."

"Choices that saved dozens more from poverty when the trade route opened!" He slammed his hand on a nearby table, making everyone jump. "Do you think maintaining a village is simple? Do you think it's all harvest festivals and pie contests? That bridge would have been inspected eventually. The flooding was unprecedented. No one could have predicted—"

"You could have." The words came out barely louder than a breath, but they cut through his justification like a blade. "The merchant who bribed you knew the bridge was failing. He came to you because he'd used substandard materials and needed time to move his assets before the truth came out. And you took his money."

Elder Matthias's face had gone the color of old parchment. Around us, the volunteers stood frozen, as if afraid that moving might shatter something irreparable. The afternoon sun had shifted, casting long shadows across the floor like accusatory fingers.

"You have no proof," he said finally. "Only old papers and wild accusations."

He was right, of course. I had no proof that would stand before a magistrate. The visions that haunted me weren't evidence. They were ghosts of emotion, echoes of truth that only I could hear. But sometimes, truth didn't need a courtroom to find its justice.

"No," I agreed. "I have no proof. But I have questions. And I think the families of those who died deserve answers." I turned to address the room, meeting the eyes of my neighbors one by one. "Don't they deserve to know why the inspection records don't match? Why the treasury shows a mysterious donation? Why Elder Matthias is so eager to dismiss concerns about documents he claims are meaningless?"

Mrs. Elmsworth stepped forward, her usual cheerfulness replaced by something stern and purposeful. "I lost my nephew in that collapse," she said quietly. "Marcus was bringing supplies for my shop. I was told it was an act of nature. Unavoidable." She looked at Elder Matthias, and I saw years of suppressed suspicion crystallizing into certainty. "But I always wondered why you pushed so hard against the memorial stone. Why you insisted we should 'move forward' so quickly."

Others began to speak then, voices overlapping as long-buried doubts found air. The baker mentioned odd discrepancies in shipping records. The stableman recalled seeing the merchant who'd overseen the bridge construction leaving the village in haste days before the collapse. Each small observation was meaningless alone, but together they wove a tapestry of complicity that couldn't be ignored.

Elder Matthias stood in the center of it all, his authority crumbling like old mortar. He looked older suddenly, the weight of his secret finally showing on his shoulders. When he spoke again, his voice carried the exhaustion of a man who'd been running from

from the truth for years.

"You don't understand the position I was in," he said, his words heavy with the kind of weariness that comes from carrying guilt like stones in your pockets. "The merchant's guild was threatening to reroute entirely around Millhaven. We would have become a forgotten waystation, bleeding families to larger towns, watching our children leave for opportunities we couldn't provide. The bridge needed repairs, yes, but the inspector was demanding immediate closure. Six months, he said. Maybe a year. Do you have any idea what that would have meant?"

"So you falsified the inspection," I said, the ledger still warm against my chest. "You took a bribe to declare it safe, hoping what? That it would hold until after the trade route was secured?"

His silence was answer enough. Around us, the hall felt smaller, as if the walls were drawing in to bear witness to this unraveling. Someone had lit the oil lamps, though I hadn't noticed when, and their flickering light made everything feel unstable, shifting between revelation and shadow.

"I thought we had time," Elder Matthias continued, his voice barely audible. "The merchant, Garrett Stonefield, he swore the supports would hold through summer. Just long enough to establish the route, to bring in enough revenue to fund proper repairs. No one was supposed to die. It was meant to be a temporary risk for permanent prosperity."

"Garrett Stonefield." Mrs. Elmsworth's voice cut through the hall like winter wind. "The man who left town the week before the collapse. Who sold his holdings here and never returned." She turned to face the gathered volunteers, her face set in lines of determined fury. "The man who knew exactly when that bridge would fail."

The truth hung in the air like smoke from a snuffed candle, acrid and undeniable. I watched Elder Matthias shrink before us, the powerful village leader becoming just an old man who had made a terrible choice and spent years trying to live with it. Part of me, a small part, felt pity for him. But then I remembered the echo of that crying woman, the abandoned child's wagon, and my sympathy evaporated like morning dew.

"The families deserve to know," I said. "Thomas Brightwater's widow, she blamed herself for asking him to make that trip. Marcus Irondale's mother still lights a candle every week, praying for forgiveness for some imagined failure as a parent. Felix Morrow's wife... she was pregnant when he died. Their son has never known his father. They've carried guilt that was never theirs to bear."

Elder Matthias sank onto a bench, his head in his hands. "I've tried to make amends. Anonymous gifts to the families, ensuring their children received apprenticeships, covering debts quietly. I've spent five years trying to balance the scales."

"But you never gave them the one thing that might have helped them heal," Mrs. Elmsworth said sharply. "The truth. The knowledge that it wasn't random misfortune or divine punishment. That someone was responsible."

The hall had filled with more people as word spread through the village. I recognized faces from the market, from the temple, from the fields. They pressed in, drawn by the gravity of unfolding scandal. Among them, I spotted a familiar figure pushing through the crowd. Constable Harwick, his uniform hastily thrown over work clothes, his expression grim.

"What's all this then?" he asked, though his tone suggested he already had some idea. Small villages had few secrets that stayed completely buried.

Mrs. Elmsworth took charge, her natural authority asserting itself. "We've discovered irregularities in the old inspection records for the Silverbrook Bridge. Elder Matthias has admitted to falsifying documents prior to the collapse five years ago."

The constable's weathered face hardened. He'd been the one to pull bodies from the river, I remembered. He'd been the one to deliver the news to waiting families. "Is this true, Matthias?"

Elder Matthias raised his head, and for a moment, I saw him consider denial. But perhaps he was tired of carrying the weight, or perhaps he recognized that the truth had developed its own momentum now, impossible to stop. "Yes," he said simply. "I accepted a bribe to approve a false inspection. I believed the risk was minimal. I was wrong."

The admission rippled through the crowd like a stone dropped in still water. Some gasped, others muttered prayers, and a few began to weep. I saw Samuel Brightwater, Thomas's eldest son, push forward, his carpenter's hands clenched into fists.

"You knew," Samuel said, his voice thick with rage and grief. "You stood at my father's memorial and spoke of unavoidable tragedy. You held my mother while she wept. You knew, and you said nothing."

"I'm sorry," Elder Matthias began, but Samuel's bitter laugh cut him off.

"Sorry? My mother died believing she'd sent father to his death with her requests for special fabric. She never forgave herself. The guilt ate her alive, and you could have lifted that burden with a word of truth. But you chose your reputation over her peace."

The constable stepped between them, one hand on Samuel's shoulder. "That's enough. There will be time for recriminations later. Elder Matthias, you'll need to come with me. We'll send to Glyphmere for a magistrate. This is beyond village justice now."

As the constable led Elder Matthias away, the crowd parted silently. The man who had shaped our village for two decades walked through them like a ghost, already absent from the life he'd built. At the doorway, he paused and looked back at me.

"How did you know?" he asked, genuine puzzlement in his voice. "Those records were buried deep. No one else ever questioned them."

I couldn't explain about the echoes, about the visions that clung to objects like morning dew on spider silk. So I gave him a different truth, one he could understand. "The dead don't rest easy when justice is denied. Their stories find a way to be heard, through whatever vessel will listen."

He nodded slowly, as if that made perfect sense, and then he was gone, swallowed by the gathering dusk outside.

The hall erupted in discussion the moment he left. People clustered in groups, sharing theories and remembrances, piecing together signs they'd dismissed or ignored. Mrs. Elmsworth organized them with practiced efficiency, appointing some to gather relevant documents, others to compile a list of those affected by the collapse, and still others to prepare for the magistrate's arrival.

I slipped away from the chaos, the green ledger still clutched against my chest. The storage room felt different now, lighter somehow, as if releasing that secret had cleared the air of more than just dust. I set the ledger carefully back in its chest, running my fingers one last time over its faded binding. The echoes were quiet now, the merchant's terror and guilt finally given voice after five years of silence.

"That was brave, what you did." 

I turned to find Samuel Brightwater in the doorway. His anger had faded, replaced by something raw and vulnerable.

"I just asked questions," I said. "The truth revealed itself."

"No," he said firmly. "You stood up to him. Elder Matthias, he had a way of making you feel foolish for questioning him. Like you were a child who didn't understand how the world really worked. But you didn't back down."

"I had help," I admitted, though he couldn't know what kind. "The evidence was there. Someone just needed to look."

Samuel was quiet for a moment, then said, "My mother would have been grateful. She died last winter, still carrying that guilt. But maybe... maybe knowing the truth would have only hurt her more. Maybe it's better she never knew."

"Maybe," I agreed, though I wasn't sure I believed it. In my experience, truth had its own kind of healing, even when it hurt. Lies festered like untreated wounds, poisoning everything around them.

The festival preparations had been abandoned, banners and decorations scattered like aftermath of a storm. Tomorrow's celebration seemed impossible now, with the village reeling from revelation. But as I watched my neighbors rally together, supporting those who grieved anew and organizing for what came next, I thought perhaps we were stronger than we knew. Truth had shaken our foundations, but it hadn't toppled them.

Mrs. Elmsworth appeared at my elbow, her usual energy subdued but still present. "You've got a gift, dear," she said quietly. "Seeing what others miss. That's valuable, especially in times like these."

If only she knew how literal that gift was. But I simply nodded, accepting her praise while knowing I could never fully explain how I'd known where to look, what questions to ask.

"What will happen to him?" I asked. "To Elder Matthias?"

"The magistrate will decide. Exile, most likely. Possibly imprisonment. The merchant, Stonefield, if they can find him, will face worse. He knew the bridge would fail. That makes it murder, not just negligence." She sighed, looking older than her years. "The village will need new leadership. People we can trust."

"You should stand for the council," I suggested. "People respect you."

She laughed, though there was little humor in it. "Perhaps. Though after today, I think we'll all be slower to trust, more eager to question. That's not necessarily bad. Blind faith in authority is what allowed this to happen."

As the evening wore on, the hall slowly emptied. Families drifted home to process the day's revelations in private. The abandoned festival preparations would be dealt with tomorrow, or perhaps not at all. Some celebrations couldn't survive the harsh light of truth.

I was among the last to leave, helping to extinguish the oil lamps and secure the building. Outside, the village looked the same as it always had. The same thatched roofs and cobbled streets, the same market square and ancient oak. But something fundamental had shifted, like a bone reset after being broken. It would heal, but it would always bear the mark of this day.

As I walked home through streets silvered by moonlight, I thought about the gift I carried, this ability to read the emotional echoes of objects. I'd always seen it as a curiosity, sometimes a burden, occasionally useful for small kindnesses. But today had shown me it could be more. In a world where powerful men buried their crimes beneath respectability and authority, perhaps there was value in someone who could hear the voices of the past, who could give the dead their say in the affairs of the living.

The green ledger had told its story, had finally released the truth it had held for five years. But there were other objects in the world, other secrets waiting to be discovered. Other voices that deserved to be heard.

I thought of Elder Matthias, probably spending tonight in the constable's holding cell, awaiting judgment for choices made in fear and greed. I thought of the families who would finally understand that their loved ones' deaths weren't random tragedy but preventable loss. I thought of the merchant who had fled, believing his crime successfully buried, not knowing that objects remember what people try to forget.

Most of all, I thought of tomorrow. The festival would likely be canceled, the founding ceremony foregone in favor of grieving and reckoning. But eventually, the village would need to move forward. New leadership would emerge, hopefully wiser and more transparent than what came before. The trade routes would continue, the merchants would still need the bridge that had been properly rebuilt after the collapse. Life would go on, marked but not broken by tragedy and revelation.

When I reached my mother's shop, I paused before entering. Through the window, I could see her working by candlelight, her fingers moving steadily over fabric, creating something beautiful from raw materials. She would have questions about why I was so late, about the rumors that were surely already spreading through the village like wildfire.

But first, I wanted one more moment with

But first, I wanted one more moment with the weight of what had happened. The night air carried the scent of woodsmoke and approaching autumn, familiar and grounding. I pressed my palm against the shop's rough wooden door frame, and for a moment, I felt it: the echo of countless homecomings, layers of contentment and exhaustion, worry and relief. My mother's emotions, my father's before his death, mine from childhood through to this very moment. This building held our family's story in its bones, just as the green ledger had held the village's secret shame.

The door's bell chimed softly as I entered, and my mother looked up from her work. Elara Ashworth had the kind of face that invited confidences, weathered by years but still striking, with eyes the same unusual amber as mine. Those eyes widened as she took in my appearance, disheveled from the day's upheaval.

"You look like you've seen a ghost," she said, setting aside the midnight-blue fabric she'd been hemming. "Several, actually."

"In a way, I have." I sank into the chair across from her worktable, suddenly exhausted. "Elder Matthias has been arrested. He falsified the inspection reports for the Silverbrook Bridge before it collapsed."

The needle slipped from her fingers, clattering onto the floor. My mother never dropped her tools. In all my years of watching her work, I'd never seen her hands falter. "Matthias? But he... how do you know this?"

"I found evidence in the old records. He confessed when confronted." I kept my explanation simple, though I could see questions forming in the furrow of her brow. My mother had always suspected there was something different about me, something beyond what could be easily explained. But we'd developed an unspoken agreement over the years, dancing around the edges of my peculiarity without ever addressing it directly.

She was quiet for a long moment, then rose and moved to the kettle hanging over the banked fire. The familiar ritual of tea-making filled the silence, giving us both time to think. When she finally spoke, her voice was carefully neutral. "You found evidence that everyone else missed. Evidence from five years ago, buried in storage."

"Yes."

"Evidence that was compelling enough to make Elder Matthias, the most powerful man in our village, confess to a crime that will destroy him."

"Yes."

She handed me a cup of tea, the ceramic warm against my palms. Then she sat back down, fixing me with that particular look mothers perfect, the one that says they know exactly what you're not telling them. "Your grandmother could do it too, you know. See things others couldn't. Feel things that had already happened."

The words hung between us like a bridge suddenly appearing over a chasm I'd thought uncrossable. All these years of careful silence, and my mother had known. Of course she had known.

"Why didn't you ever say anything?" I asked, my voice smaller than intended.

"Because your grandmother spent her life being feared for it. People called her touched, said she communed with spirits, crossed themselves when she passed. I watched it isolate her, even as they came to her in secret when they needed to find lost things or understand old mysteries." She reached across the table, covering my hand with hers. "I wanted you to choose when and how to use your gift, without the weight of expectation or fear."

"But you knew what I could do."

"I suspected. When you were small, you'd touch objects and react to things that weren't there. You'd comfort toys that no one else knew were sad. You knew which chair your father preferred before he'd ever sat in it, because you could feel his presence calling to it." Her smile was soft, tinged with old sorrow. "After he died, you wouldn't go near his tools for months. You said they were too loud."

I remembered that, though I'd been barely six at the time. The echoes of his frustration and satisfaction, the weight of unfinished projects and fulfilled commissions, all of it had been overwhelming to a grieving child. It had been easier to avoid them entirely than to feel his absence in every hammer blow that still reverberated through the metal.

"Is that why you kept them?" I asked. "His tools? Even though neither of us does metalwork?"

"I kept them because someday, when you're ready, you might want to hear those echoes again. To know him through the work he loved, the pieces of himself he left behind." She squeezed my hand gently. "But that's a choice for another day. Tonight, we need to talk about what you've done and what comes next."

"What do you mean?"

"You've exposed the most powerful man in the village. You've revealed a truth that implicates not just him but the systems that allowed it to happen. The merchant's guild, the other council members who should have provided oversight, the inspectors who should have been harder to bribe." She leaned back, her expression thoughtful. "There will be consequences, Sora. Some people will be grateful for the truth. Others will resent you for disturbing their comfortable illusions."

She was right, I realized. Already I could imagine the divisions forming. Those who had lost family in the collapse would see me as a hero. Those who had benefited from Elder Matthias's leadership, who had prospered under the trade agreements he'd secured, might see me as a troublemaker who had destroyed a good man over one mistake. The village would fracture along lines of loyalty and loss, and I would be at the center of that break.

"I couldn't let it stay hidden," I said. "Those families deserved to know."

"I'm not saying you were wrong. I'm saying you need to be prepared. Your gift has always been a private thing, something you could choose to use or ignore. But after today, even if people don't understand exactly how you knew what you knew, they'll remember that you're the one who sees what others miss. Some will seek you out. Others will avoid you. None of them will look at you the same way again."

The weight of that settled over me like a heavy cloak. I'd been so focused on revealing the truth that I hadn't considered what would come after. The simple life I'd planned, helping my mother with her shop, perhaps marrying one of the merchant's sons, raising children in the safety of familiar routines, all of that seemed suddenly impossible. How could I pretend to be ordinary when I'd just toppled the village's most powerful leader with nothing but old papers and impossible knowledge?

"Your grandmother left something for you," my mother said suddenly, rising and moving to an old chest in the corner. "I was supposed to give it to you when you were ready. I think perhaps that time is now."

She returned with a small wooden box, its surface smooth with age and handling. The moment she placed it in my hands, I felt them, layers upon layers of echoes. My grandmother's determination, her loneliness, her fierce pride in a gift that had set her apart. But underneath that, stretching back further than I could fully grasp, were other women's touches. Other hands that had held this box, other hearts that had carried this burden and blessing.

Inside was a simple silver ring, unadorned except for a single symbol etched into its band: an eye, half-closed, with rays extending from it like sun or sight. The moment I touched it, I understood. This was a recognition, a sign that others like us had used to find each other across distances and years. My grandmother hadn't been alone, not entirely. There had been others who could feel the echoes, who could give voice to the memories held in stone and steel and fabric.

"She told me once that the gift chooses its own purpose in each generation," my mother said softly. "Her mother used it to find lost children. Your grandmother used it to solve mysteries that plagued the guilty and gave peace to the innocent. And now you've used it to bring justice to those who thought their crimes safely buried. That's no small thing, Sora."

I slippe
