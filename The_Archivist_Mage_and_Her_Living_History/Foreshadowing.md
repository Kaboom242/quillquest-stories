# Story Arc: Mystery 1 – Claiming Her Gift

## Arc Summary
After uncovering a buried betrayal in her village through empathic magic, Sora is quietly exiled and sent to Glyphmere—a sprawling city of adventurers, guilds, and forgotten truths. Taking a quiet role as a clerk in the Adventurer’s Guild, she begins to rebuild her life in the margins, using Echo Sight to read emotional imprints left on weapons, contracts, and artifacts.

As she helps adventurers uncover the hidden stories behind their gear, Sora slowly earns trust and respect, forming quiet bonds with those who value her insight. But the echoes she uncovers hint at deeper corruption—altered records, suppressed grief, and missions that don’t match their reports.

This arc follows Sora’s journey from isolation to quiet belonging, as she learns to trust others, assert her voice, and investigate the emotional residue of a city that’s forgotten how to feel. Her magic becomes more than a burden—it becomes a way to heal, connect, and uncover truths no one else dares to see.
