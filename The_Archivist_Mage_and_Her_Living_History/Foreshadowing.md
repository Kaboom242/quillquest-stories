# Mystery 1 – Claiming Her Gift (Revised Arc)

**Inciting Incident – The Public Fracture**  
At 16, Sora brushes an old ledger and unintentionally reveals a village elder’s buried betrayal. Instead of awe, she’s met with fear, gossip, and the quiet loss of friends.

**Backlash – A Gentle Exile**  
Her parents send her to Victoria “for education,” knowing she’s no longer welcome. She leaves with one satchel, a tea tin, and a hollow in her chest.

**New Beginning – The Guild as Paper Cage**  
Hired as a junior clerk, Sora files forms and brews tea in corridors that smell of ink and quiet ambition. Her magic is dismissed as a curiosity.

**Catalyst Case – The Unfiled Locket**  
While cataloging confiscated items, she touches a broken silver locket. Echoes reveal a rain-soaked farewell and a promise never kept.

**Moral Dilemma – Healing or Harming**  
The locket’s story leads to a widow still living in the city. Guild rules forbid interference. Truth could comfort — or reopen wounds.

**First Triumph – Choosing to See**  
Sora bends protocol: the locket “accidentally” arrives at the widow’s door. Days later, she sees the woman standing taller. Her magic isn’t useless — it’s quietly powerful.
