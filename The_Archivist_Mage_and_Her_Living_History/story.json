      "summary": "This chapter introduces Sora, who is helping to sort through old village records when she experiences a supernatural vision while touching a ledger. Through this vision, she witnesses a past event where Elder Matthias, a current village leader, accepted a bribe to falsify bridge inspection reports - a decision that likely led to the bridge's collapse years later and the deaths of three merchants. The chapter ends with Sora confronting Matthias about this discovery, creating tension as she challenges his authority in front of other villagers during festival preparations. The chapter establishes both Sora's supernatural ability to see memories through objects and introduces a central conflict involving corruption and responsibility in the village's leadership."
