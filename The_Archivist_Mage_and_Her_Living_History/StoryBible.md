Sora, a junior clerk at the Victoria Guild, possesses a unique magic: she can "read" residual magic in objects, places, and people. This ability allows her to uncover historical fragments, emotional echoes, and hidden truths.

Narrative Voice: First-person (Sora), clever, self-deprecating inner monologues. Use light humor, subtle emotional beats.
Worldbuilding: Realistic systems (guilds, factions), grounded magic (investigative). Include slice-of-life details (paperwork, tea), casual conversations that reveal character
Descriptive Language: Colorful visuals for visions/echoes. Highlight character design/emotions. 
Characterization: Sora: Clever, curious, resilient; magic as empathy. Diverse supporting cast with clear motivations; avoid caricatures.
Plot Structure: Episodic arcs (3-5 chapters) focusing on mystery/history. Each arc introduces an artifact/location, reveals a hidden story, presents a moral dilemma, and concludes with growth/impact.
