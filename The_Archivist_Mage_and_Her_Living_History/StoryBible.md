# Story Bible – Light Fantasy Adventure Novel

## Core Premise
In a world where magic is studied like science and monsters threaten civilization, adventurers risk their lives to explore ancient ruins, hunt dangerous beasts, and recover powerful artifacts. The Adventurer’s Guild serves as the backbone of this ecosystem—regulating contracts, ranking adventurers, and trading in magic items and monster parts. Sora, a clever and curious Bronze-ranked clerk with a rare God-Given Gift, finds herself drawn into mysteries that blur the line between bureaucracy and battlefield.

- Balance action with slice-of-life moments: tea, paperwork, quiet conversations.
- Build faction intrigue and long-term mysteries across arcs.
