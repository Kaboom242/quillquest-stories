4. **Temperature Drops:** Cold spots where spirits gather strength
5. **Chemical Reactions:** Existing substances begin behaving like poison gas

### **Escalation Stages**

- **Stage 2:** Clear ghostly manifestations; chemical effects begin affecting people
- **Stage 3:** Living soldiers begin crossing over; gas spirits establish territory
- **Stage 4:** Full breach; sections of Victoria transform into battlefield zones
- **Stage 5:** Permanent territorial overlap; ongoing war spills into Victorian streets

### **Vulnerable Locations in Victoria**
