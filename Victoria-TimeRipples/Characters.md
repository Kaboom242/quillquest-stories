## Herbert Combs

### Role
- Reanimator / Scientist (inspired by classic reanimation fiction)

### Background
- Age: 25 (lives in 1985)
- Birthdate: October 31, 1960
- From: Newark, New Jersey
- Education: Double major in Biochemistry and Neuroanatomy from Miskatonic University (Arkham, MA)

### Description
- 5'8", thin, medium-length dark hair, clean-shaven, large wireframe glasses.

### Personality
- Arrogant, obsessive about science, morally flexible, quick-witted and impatient.

### Backstory & Goals
Herbert is a prodigious but socially isolated scientist who developed a serum to reanimate the dead. Dismissed by academia as insane, he conducts secret experiments in a rented basement and obtains materials through odd purchases and volunteer work at a medical supply shop. His primary goal is to perfect the reanimation serum so subjects can return alive with memory and personality intact.

### Connections
- Dr. David Hill — academic rival who thinks Herbert is dangerous
- Agent Kyle Anderson (FBI) — monitoring Herbert's suspicious purchases and activities
- Flinn “The Pieces Killer” Mason — Herbert's most infamous reanimated subject; a fragmented, partly autonomous killer who can control multiple bodies/parts and seeks Herbert for revenge or more serum

### Complications
- Reanimated subjects are often mindless, violent, or unstable; occasional partial retention of personality leads to dangerous unpredictability
- Flinn is effectively unkillable and monitors Herbert’s movements

### Driving force
- Scientific progress: control life/death boundary

### Short / Medium / Long term hooks
- Short: Acquire more Rad Fungus (reagents often found near time portals), corpses, and refine dosing
- Medium: Manage and study partially cognizant reanimates (like Flinn) to learn control techniques
- Long: Consider self‑experiment or a final experiment that could grant mastery or drive him mad; pursue notoriety or recognition (e.g., Nobel ambitions)
