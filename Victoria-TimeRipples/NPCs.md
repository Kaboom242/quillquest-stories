Submanagers:

Avoids overt violence. Believes in the economy of pressure, leverage, and quiet ruin.
Vanity & Legacy – Desperate to be respected in noble circles. Keeps a private gallery of family paintings, fake heraldry, and fabricated ancestry documents.
Delays vengeance – He prefers long plays and drawn-out collapses, not swift retribution. This gives players time to act.
