## Campaign Timeline (7 Months, 35 Sessions)

### **The Black Veil's Master Plan**
**Goal:** Use 12 Clock Tower Laboratories arranged in a massive city-wide clock face to anchor temporal energy from trapped women across multiple timelines. This creates a "Temporal Web" allowing them to rewrite Victoria's timeline into a magic-ruled aristocracy.

**The Clock Face:** 12 towers positioned around Victoria like clock positions. Each tower houses a Temporal Anchor - a woman trapped from a different timeline whose life force powers the temporal manipulation.
- **Clock #9 (Already Discovered):** Empty - players returned from Rome here
- **Clock #12 (High Noon):** Billie's Sister - trapped from 1980s Philippines  
- **Clock #3:** Faena - trapped from Roman timeline
- **Clock #6:** Unknown anchor from Jurassic era
- **Clock #1:** Unknown anchor from WWI timeline
- **Clock #8:** Unknown anchor from 2020s zombie timeline

**Timeline:** 
- **Phase 1 (Months 1-3):** Capture remaining anchors, activate clock towers
- **Phase 2 (Months 4-5):** Use anchors to harvest temporal energy during manufactured crises
- **Phase 3 (Months 6-7):** Complete the Temporal Web, execute the Great Rewriting

- **#12 (High Noon):** Billie's Sister - Web control center  
- **#3 (3 o'clock):** Faena - Roman timeline anchor
- **#6 (6 o'clock):** Silerian scientist - Jurassic timeline anchor
- **#1 (1 o'clock):** WWI nurse - trench warfare timeline

## GM Quick Reference - Session Structure:
Each session should include:
1. **Clear Objective** (specific, measurable goal)
2. **Opposition Details** (exact numbers, capabilities, motivations)  
3. **Success/Failure Conditions** (what happens either way)
4. **Player Choices** (meaningful options with different consequences)
5. **Stakes** (what players lose if they fail)
6. **Rewards** (resources, allies, information gained)

## Backup Plans for Player Choices:
- **If players ignore main plot:** Black Veil accelerates Clock Tower activations, creates reality distortions that force engagement
- **If players split the party:** Assign different Clock Towers to different groups with connected objectives
- **If key anchors die:** Other anchors can provide same information; Billie's sister remains central emotional core
- **If players derail completely:** Use "temporal cascade" to reset situation with new urgency and clear countdown timer
