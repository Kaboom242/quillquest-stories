# Victoria — Story Bible
This is a Table Top RPG Game I am running as a GM. These are my Notes and Organizing Documents.

## Overview
Victoria is a dark, gothic, gritty city that resembles a Victorian London. The year is 1868. Industry and rapid social change grip the city; it is almost always covered in smog and fog. The city lives and breathes at night, and many actors—official and hidden—work to keep powerful secrets.

Tone & themes: gothic, industrial grime, political intrigue, temporal mystery, and hidden supernatural threats.

## High concept
Victoria is a nexus that pulls and traps people, objects, and events from other times and realities. Some of those who arrive are "Wanderers": marked individuals who can traverse time and parallel worlds. Others from other eras try to hide and blend in. Temporal objects and artifacts appear across the city; factions fight to control them.

## Core mechanics / world rules (suggested)
- Wanderers: Rare, marked people who can focus on temporal objects to open connections to other times and places.
- Temporal Objects: Items with a link to other eras; they act as anchors or keys for travel.
- Portals / Chrono Energy Modules: Locations or devices that can shift the time period or link to a specific era.
- Not everyone from another time is a wanderer; some are immigrants, refugees, spies, or stranded visitors.

## City districts (quick reference)
- Royal Palace — seat of the crown and ceremonial power.
- Stone Crown — estates of old families, traditional markets, and established businesses.
- Green Borough — wealthy manors, Parliamentarian politicians, and landscaped hills.
- Crosswind Heights — Royal College, observatory, and barracks for the Royal Army.
- Parliament Square — political center and debates.
- Crown Promenade — prestigious banking and high-end establishments.
- Stormbell Quarter — named for its ancient bell tower; a hub for outcasts and forgotten markets.
- Weeping Dredge — (mysterious; expand with a hook or key location).
- Gutterhaven — poverty-stricken district with extensive grates and under-streets.
- Blacktyre Canals — inky waterways and hard-to-reach neighborhoods.
- Red Lantern Row — territory of the Crimson Lotus Syndicate.
- Ebonford Cross — crossroad district (expand detail).
- Ashgrove Greens — once-beautiful park, now overgrown; twisting paths hide secluded spots.
- Candlewick Market — sprawling marketplace known for shady deals and black‑market wares.
- Iron Spire Row — factories, soot, and industrial power.
- Chimney Shroud District — dense with furnace and chimney housing.
- Hallowshade Ward — eerily clean, sleepy residential area; appearances hide something unsettling.
- Amberfire Knot — gated, secretive community with ties to the crown and Parliament.
- Hook End — docks and fish markets; a rough area for fights and brawls.
- East Dock — major port and arrival point.

## Factions (ideas and hooks)
- Government / Parliament: The real holders of power; politics are corrupt and self-serving.
  - Anti‑Royalist Party and other political factions vie for influence.
- Royals: Figureheads who want to reclaim lost authority.

- Great Royal Museum: Custodian of curiosities and possible temporal artifacts.
- Trade organizations & labor: Unions and guilds that control production and transport.
- River port & docks: Merchant ships, iron ships, and pirates.
  - Eastern Trading Company (example)
- Commercial district: Banks, shops, and private interests.

Criminal & secret societies
- The Black Veil: A shadowy cabal of radical scientists, royal insiders, and politicians who have access to time travel or portals.
- The Iron Syndicate: Controls labor, unions (coal, iron, trains, factories). Leadership known as the "Five Fingers."
  - Steamwrights’ Union: Industrial rebels and saboteurs (subfaction).
- Smog Rats: Loose band of thieves and pickpockets.
  - Notable types: "Ghost of the West", "Shadow Baron" (names to expand into NPCs).
- Gilded Grasp: A criminal group focused on extraction and influence.
- Cultists of the Horn: Occult group with mysterious aims tied to temporal rifts.

## Notable locations and hooks
- Great Royal Museum: secret wing with recovered temporal artifacts.
- Candlewick Market stalls selling smuggled items from other eras.
- Blacktyre canals: hidden docks where alien or future goods arrive.
- Hallowshade Ward: neighbors who are 'too perfect'—suspected mind control or temporal alteration.

(Each of these can be a linked node controlled by temporal objects or portals. Decide which are permanent campaign locations vs one-shot adventure seeds.)

## Story hooks & campaign seeds
- A political murder reveals a smuggled temporal artifact in Parliament.
- The Black Veil attempts to harness a Chrono Module to change an election outcome.
- A wanderer arrives carrying a map to a lost vault in Atlantis 1500 AD.
- A factory strike escalates when the Iron Syndicate sabotages a portal to bring in expendable labor.
- A portal opens in Hallowshade and a neighborhood begins to lose memories.
- Jericho (from character list) tries to recruit the Smog Rats to seize control of Red Lantern Row.

## Suggested areas of improvement (actionable)
1. Clarify the rules for time travel and Temporal Objects
   - Define what makes someone a "Wanderer" (marking, rarity, limits).
   - Decide whether portals are stable, stationary devices, or temporary events.
   - Create simple, consistent mechanics for how artifacts interact with characters.

2. Flesh out the map and district relationships
   - Add a simple map or ASCII diagram showing relative district locations.
   - Note travel times, major thoroughfares, and danger levels for each district.

3. Prioritize factions and concrete goals
   - Pick 3–5 primary factions for the early campaign (e.g., Parliament, Black Veil, Iron Syndicate, Crimson Lotus) and define their goals, resources, and antagonists.

4. Clean up timelines and canon
   - Decide which connected times are canon to the campaign and which are one-off curiosities.
   - Create a timeline index to avoid contradictions (e.g., character birthdates vs campaign year).

5. Create NPC statlines and beats
   - Turn key names into short NPC cards (1‑paragraph hook, motive, and sample scene).

6. Tone and sensory details
   - Add sensory lines (smell of tar and iron, constant coughing from smog, gaslight flicker) to reinforce atmosphere.

7. File structure and tooling
   - Split the bible into separate files: `map.md`, `factions.md`, `hooks.md`, `timelines.md`, and `locations/*.md` for long descriptions.
   - Consider a JSON or YAML index if you want to use tools to query locations/factions.

## Small editorial fixes applied
- Standardized spelling and grammar, removed duplicate or malformed lines, and organized the raw list into structured sections.
