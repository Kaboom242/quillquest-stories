# Reanimation Fluid — Herbert's Notes

> Fictional game document: in-world notes describing Doctor Herbert's experimental "Reanimation Fluid." This is meant for storytelling and game mechanics only — not real recipes or lab instructions.

## Summary
Doctor Herbert's Reanimation Fluid is a mutable, arcane‑adjacent serum that briefly restores animation to recently dead tissue. Greater quantities or purer reagents increase potency but also multiply cognitive damage: memory bleed, delirium, and madness. Herbert tweaks culture, catalysts, and "time-salts" trying to isolate a stable formula; each batch is unpredictable and narratively rich.

## In-world purpose & tone
- Tone: gothic-scientific, tragic, and morally ambiguous — this is horror/science‑fiction, not safe science.  
- Function: short-lived reanimation for interrogation, research, or desperate restoration. It yields knowledge, favors, and horrific consequences.  
- Dramatic hook: Herbert seeks a variant that preserves identity without the madness — a forbidden, campaign-driving obsession.
## Fictional reagent types (table)

| Reagent                     | Madness + | Tier  | Special effect (story + mechanical hint)                                                                                    |
| --------------------------- | --------: | :---: | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Saline Water                |         0 |   0   | Inert diluent; stabilizes mixtures. (No madness change; small bonus to Stabilization rolls.)                                |
| Bactrim Cultures            |        +1 |   1   | Living slurry that heightens neural receptivity. (+1D to Stabilization; raises chance of memory bleed.)                     |
| Potassium–Sodium Tartrate   |        +2 |   2   | Time‑salt analogue; amplifies temporal resonance. (+1S potency; +2 shift on Madness roll risk.)                             |
| Animal Blood                |         0 |   0   | Common filler; gives biological texture to the revival. (Small sensory clues, low madness.)                                 |
| Human Blood                 |        +1 |   1   | Stronger identity imprint; clearer personal recall. (+1D to Recall quality; mild madness rise.)                             |
| Demon Blood                 |        +3 |   3   | Unstable, otherworldly echoing; violent or prophetic returns. (High potency; severe madness/hostility.)                     |
| Polymerized Hemoglobin      |        +1 |   2   | Synthetic binder that improves tissue cohesion and short-term stability. (Reduces convulsion risk; adds uncanny stillness.) |
| Ectoplasm                   |        +2 |   3   | Ghostly stabilizer that can restore personality fragments. (High chance of lucid memory; unpredictable side-effects.)       |
| Quicksilver (Mercurial Oil) |        +2 |   2   | Volatile binder; smooths circulation but causes odd reflexes. (Improves Administration rolls; raises madness volatility.)   |
| Void Salt                   |        +3 |   3   | Rare salt from rift-edges; amplifies cross-temporal bleed. (Very high potency and very high madness risk.)                  |
| Mandrake Root               |        +1 |   1   | Folk stabilizer with sedative-dream residue. (Calms agitation; memories are dreamlike.)                                     |
| Radiolytic Proteins         |        +2 |   2   | Energizes neural pathways; produces vivid visions. (+1D to clarity; adds hallucinatory tags.)                               |
| Bone Ash                    |         0 |   1   | Grounding filler; extends animation window slightly. (Gives fragmentary physical memories.)                                 |
| Moonstone Ash               |        +2 |   2   | Lunar resonance; favors nocturnal or dream-memories. (Memory is poetic/cryptic; raises madness.)                            |
| Shroud Silk                 |         0 |   1   | Used as infusion medium; smooths memory threads. (Reduces noise; helps Containment.)                                        |
| Angel's Tear                |        +2 |   3   | Rare catalyst; can produce moments of near‑holy lucidity. (High clue value; heavy moral and madness cost.)                  |
| Dream Essence               |        +2 |   3   | Concentrated oneiric tincture; yields coherent but warped recall. (Great clues; strong psychic backlash.)                   |

How to use these in play (quick)
- "Madness +" = number of steps to shift worse on the Madness table (narrative). Add this to the Madness roll or apply as GM shift.  
- Tier (0–3) indicates the reagent’s narrative potency and what Tier mixes it can unlock. Higher-tier reagents enable Tier 2–3 outcomes.  
- Some reagents grant mechanical bonuses (noted as +1D or +1S in the effect). Treat these as story‑first modifiers; never provide real-world instructions.  
- When mixing, total the Madness + values to determine the overall Madness risk and apply Stability/Administration/Containment checks normally (D6 success System)

## Game mechanics (WARPS / D6 success system)
These mechanics use your existing check rules: roll a pool of d6 equal to Stat dice + modifiers; 5s and 6s count as Successes.

### Step 1: Serum Creation & Mixing
Players select reagents from the table and calculate the serum's properties before use.

**Mixing calculations (deterministic):**
- **Total Madness Risk** = sum of all "Madness +" values from selected reagents
- **Maximum Tier** = highest individual Tier among selected reagents
- **Stability Modifier** = +1D for each Tier-0 reagent (Saline, Animal Blood, Bone Ash, Shroud Silk)
- **Potency Modifier** = +1S for each Tier-3 reagent (Demon Blood, Ectoplasm, Void Salt, Angel's Tear, Dream Essence)

**Example:** Potassium-Sodium Tartrate (Madness +2, Tier 2) + Human Blood x2 (Madness +2, Tier 1) + Saline (Madness 0, Tier 0)
- Total Madness Risk = 2 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 4
- Maximum Tier = 2
- Stability Modifier = +1D (from Saline)
- Potency Modifier = +0S (no Tier-3 reagents)

### Step 2: Stabilization Check (preparing the batch)
- **Who rolls:** The experimenter (usually Herbert) — roll INT pool + Stability Modifiers
- **Target:** 2S for a stable batch (adjust based on Maximum Tier: Tier 0-1 = 1S, Tier 2 = 2S, Tier 3 = 3S)
- **Outcomes:**
  - Success = stable batch ready for use; apply Potency Modifiers to Administration
  - Fail = unstable batch; experimenter loses 1-2 Con, batch has -1S penalty to Administration
- **Special:** Add any reagent-specific bonuses (e.g., Bactrim Cultures = +1D to Stabilization)

### Step 3: Administration & Revival Check
- **Who rolls:** The acting PC (DEX for injection, INT for ritual preparation)
- **Target:** Variable based on desired outcome (1S = twitch, 2S = partial recall, 3S = coherent speech, 4S+ = extended lucidity)
- **Modifiers:** Apply Potency Modifiers (+1S per Tier-3 reagent) and any reagent-specific bonuses
- **Outcomes by Success:**
  - 1S — reflexive movement; small tactile clue only
  - 2S — fragmented speech; 1-2 names/locations (useful but ambiguous)
  - 3S — coherent recall; answers 2-3 direct questions clearly
  - 4S+ — extended lucidity; major revelation or detailed testimony
- **Fail (0S):** Subject convulses;

### Step 4: Containment Check
- **Who rolls:** Team effort (primary roller uses INT/SENSE, others can contribute dice)
- **Target:** 1-2S depending on Administration success level
- **Success:** Information extracted and preserved
- **Fail:** Subject becomes violent, escapes, or information is lost/corrupted

### Step 5: Madness & Side Effects (LLM-Generated)
Instead of random rolling, use the **LLM Prompt System** below to generate narrative outcomes based on the serum's calculated properties.

## LLM Prompt System for Narrative Outcomes

**Template Prompt (copy this to your LLM):**

```
You are a gothic horror GM assistant. Generate the narrative outcome for a Reanimation Fluid experiment based on these calculated properties:

SERUM PROPERTIES:
- Total Madness Risk: [X]
- Maximum Tier: [X] 
- Reagents Used: [list with quantities]
- Administration Result: [XS] (successes achieved)
- Subject Background: [brief description of the corpse/who they were]

GUIDELINES:
- Higher Madness Risk (4+) = more severe psychological effects
- Higher Tier (2-3) = more supernatural/otherworldly effects  
- Lower Administration Success = more chaotic/unpredictable outcomes
- Include specific sensory details and quoted speech from the subject
- Suggest 1-2 mechanical consequences (Con loss, trauma tags, faction attention)
- End with a clear decision point or complication for the players

TONE: Gothic scientific horror, morally ambiguous, emphasize consequences

Generate a 2-3 paragraph narrative outcome.
```

**Example filled prompt:**
```
SERUM PROPERTIES:
- Total Madness Risk: 4

### Quick Reference for GMs
**Madness Risk Scale:**
- 0-1: Minimal side effects, mostly successful
- 2-3: Moderate madness, useful but concerning
- 4-5: High madness, major consequences likely  
- 6+: Severe madness, dangerous outcomes, long-term effects

**Tier Effects:**
- Tier 0-1: Mundane effects, realistic responses
- Tier 2: Supernatural elements, temporal echoes
- Tier 3: Otherworldly phenomena, reality distortions

## Madness & Side Effects (Herbert's Scale)
**Default Madness Level:** All reanimated subjects start at **Level 8 (Crazed Blood thirst)** unless modified by reagents.

**Calculating Final Madness Level:**
- Start at Level 8 (default)
- Apply reagent modifications from the table:
  - Madness + reagents: increase level by their "Madness +" value
  - Stabilizing reagents: Mandrake Root (-1), Shroud Silk (-1), Bone Ash (-1)
- Maximum level: 10 (Self-Destructive)
- Minimum level: 1 (Mildly Altered)

**Madness Scale (Herbert's Research Notes):**

| Level | Type                     | Behavior & Mechanical Effects                                                                        |
| ----- | ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 10    | Self-Destructive Madness | Rips own flesh from their bones. (Self-harm; dies within 1-2 minutes; no useful information.)        |
| 9     | Hungry Manic             | No personal safety, mostly biting. (Attacks nearest target; ignore pain; difficult to contain.)      |
| 8     | Crazed Blood thirst      | Attacks wildly at all. (DEFAULT - Combat encounter; 1-2 rounds of violence before restrainable.)     |
| 7     | Disconnected             | Won't listen, will rip off body parts to avoid interaction. (Avoids contact; limited communication.) |
| 6     | Runner                   | Attempts to escape and murder randomly. (Chase scene; kills bystanders if not contained.)            |
| 5     | Premeditative Murder     | Attempts to escape, murders with intent. (Cunning; plans attacks; high danger to NPCs.)              |
| 4     | Emotional Explosion      | Wild emotions, crying and screaming. (Useful intel between outbursts; traumatic to witness.)         |
| 3     | Paranoia                 | Will listen but secretly distrustful. (Answers questions but gives false leads; misdirection risk.)  |
| 2     | Twitchy                  | Twitching and talking to themselves. (Coherent but disturbing; good intel with patience.)            |
| 1     | Mildly Altered Normalcy  | Unnerving gaze, rarely blinking, quick to anger. (Best case - clear answers but unsettling.)         |

**Example Calculations:**
- Standard batch (Saline + Human Blood): Level 8 + 1 (Human Blood) = **Level 9 (Hungry Manic)**
- Stabilized batch (Saline + Human Blood + Mandrake Root + Shroud Silk): Level 8 + 1 - 1 - 1 = **Level 7 (Disconnected)**
- High-tier batch (Demon Blood + Void Salt): Level 8 + 3 + 3 = **Level 10+ (capped at 10 - Self-Destructive)**

**Herbert's Goal:** Find reagent combinations that reduce subjects to Level 1-3 for useful interrogation without extreme violence or self-destruction.

**GM Usage:**
- Use the calculated level to determine immediate behavior and containment difficulty
- Lower levels (1-4) allow for meaningful information extraction
- Higher levels (6-10) create combat encounters or chase scenes
- Level 4-5 subjects may provide crucial intel between violent episodes

## Potency tiers (narrative scale)
- Tier 0 — Trace: tiny effect; useful only for forensic residue.  
- Tier 1 — Standard: short twitch → 1–2 usable clues; 1–2 Con cost on failure.  
- Tier 2 — Potent: up to 2 minutes of coherent speech; higher madness risk; costs resources.  
- Tier 3 — Cataclysmic: extended lucidity or permanent changes; high chance of severe madness or mutation. Reserve for major story beats.
