# Reanimation Fluid — Herbert's Notes

> Fictional game document: in-world notes describing Doctor Herbert's experimental "Reanimation Fluid." This is meant for storytelling and game mechanics only — not real recipes or lab instructions.

## Summary
Doctor Herbert's Reanimation Fluid is a mutable, arcane‑adjacent serum that briefly restores animation to recently dead tissue. Greater quantities or purer reagents increase potency but also multiply cognitive damage: memory bleed, delirium, and madness. Herbert tweaks culture, catalysts, and "time-salts" trying to isolate a stable formula; each batch is unpredictable and narratively rich.

## In-world purpose & tone
- Tone: gothic-scientific, tragic, and morally ambiguous — this is horror/science‑fiction, not safe science.  
- Function: short-lived reanimation for interrogation, research, or desperate restoration. It yields knowledge, favors, and horrific consequences.  
- Dramatic hook: Herbert seeks a variant that preserves identity without the madness — a forbidden, campaign-driving obsession.

## Mechanics
Craft Serum
Concoct: Downtime (1S + INT)
  - May continue concocting the serum another day.
  - 1S: (Concentrated Solution) +2D Reanimation Dice Pool (Max 8)
  - 1S: (Stabilize Reagents) +2D Stability Dice Pool (Max 8)
  - [1F]: Add Sense + Spirit

Inject (Reanimate) Full: (Roll Reanimation Dice) + INT (can add or subtract successes)
 - 0S: Corpse explosion
 - 1S: Chroniberg abomination
 - 2S: Extreme muscle overgrowth / regeneration
 - 3S: Slight muscle regeneration
 - 4S: Normal
 - 5S: Slow withering
 - 6S: Disintegrating to dust

Inject (Stabilize) Full: (Roll Stabilize Dice)
 - 0S: Scream and die
 - 1S: Reanimate with Full Madness (6)
 - 2S: Reanimate with Madness 5
 - 3S: Reanimate with Madness 4
 - 4S: Reanimate with Madness 3
 - 5S: Reanimate with Madness 2
 - 6S: Reanimate with Madness 1

**Madness Scale**
1. Mildly Altered Normalcy (Level 1) — Unnerving gaze, rarely blinking, quick to anger. (Best case — clear answers but unsettling.)
2. Emotional Explosion (Level 2) — Wild emotions: crying, screaming, twitching, and talking to themselves.
3. Premeditative Murder (Level 3) — Attempts to escape and murders with intent; cunning and capable of planning attacks (high danger to NPCs).
4. Disconnected (Level 4) — Avoids sensory input; may rip off body parts to avoid interaction and attempts to stop sound sources or create loud noises.
5. Crazed Blood-thirst (Level 5) — Attacks wildly; default combat encounter for 1–2 rounds before being restrainable.
6. Hungry Manic (Level 6) — No regard for personal safety; attacks indiscriminately and is extremely dangerous.

## Experimental Research
Downtime 1F (Requires restrained reanimated test subject)
Research INT + 1D, resisted by subject 1D
 - 0S: Break free / escape
 - 1S: Increase Reanimation Dice Pool max by 1 (Max 16). If rolling 2D: on 0S the subject dies, otherwise the subject gets stronger (+2D)
 - 1S: Increase Stability Dice Pool max by 1 (Max 16). If rolling 2D: on 0S the subject dies, otherwise the subject gets stronger (+2D)
 - 2S: Increase either pool by 1; subject gets stronger (+1D)
 - 1S: Kill subject
Other party members can help try to prevent escape (might get hurt / stressed).
Better equipment can give a bonus to the check (restraints, manacles, etc).

## Growing Fear
Gain XD Stress Per day, 1D per Reanimated being that is present in the world.
