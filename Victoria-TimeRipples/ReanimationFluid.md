# Reanimation Fluid — Herbert's Notes

> Fictional game document: in-world notes describing Doctor Herbert's experimental "Reanimation Fluid." This is meant for storytelling and game mechanics only — not real recipes or lab instructions.

## Summary
Doctor Herbert's Reanimation Fluid is a mutable, arcane‑adjacent serum that briefly restores animation to recently dead tissue. Greater quantities or purer reagents increase potency but also multiply cognitive damage: memory bleed, delirium, and madness. Herbert tweaks culture, catalysts, and "time-salts" trying to isolate a stable formula; each batch is unpredictable and narratively rich.

## In-world purpose & tone
- Tone: gothic-scientific, tragic, and morally ambiguous — this is horror/science‑fiction, not safe science.  
- Function: short-lived reanimation for interrogation, research, or desperate restoration. It yields knowledge, favors, and horrific consequences.  
- Dramatic hook: Herbert seeks a variant that preserves identity without the madness — a forbidden, campaign-driving obsession.

## Fictional reagent types (gameable, non-technical)
Use these as story elements and mechanical modifiers — not as real chemicals.

- Bactrim Culture (in-world name): Herbert's living slurry — a cultured biomass that heightens neural receptivity. (Fictionalized; treat as a game reagent.)
- Rad‑Fungal Slurry: a bioluminescent mold that leaves a faint glow and portal residue; increases arcane resonance.  
- Nocturne Wax: an oil that slows decay and lengthens animation window.  
- Time‑Salt: crystallized, mysterious salts harvested near temporal rifts; amplifies potency but warps memory.  
- Ectoplasmic Tincture: alchemical tincture with ghostly associations; stabilizes short-memory recall at a cost.  
- Mercurial Oil (fictional): volatile binder that improves tissue cohesion for a few minutes.

Each reagent is a narrative knob: more Time‑Salt → stronger recall but heavier madness; more Nocturne Wax → longer animation but slurred cognition.

## Game mechanics (WARPS / D6 success system)
These mechanics use your existing check rules: roll a pool of d6 equal to Stat dice + modifiers; 5s and 6s count as Successes.

Context: The PC or NPC administers the fluid to a recently dead subject (within scene framing). The GM sets the conditions (freshness of body, reagent tier, environment). Then resolve with the following checks.

1) Stabilization Check (preparing/priming the batch)
- Who rolls: the experimenter (Herbert or PC scientist) — roll INT pool.  
- Modifier: +1D if a Tier‑1 stabilizer present (Nocturne Wax), +1S auto-success if Herbert spends a rare catalyst.  
- Outcomes: 1S = brittle batch (short), 2S = usable (standard), 3S+ = potent (longer/clearer animation).  
- Fail (0S): batch sputters — loses time, costs 1 Con for the experimenter and triggers minor contamination (narrative complication).

2) Administration & Revival Check
- Who rolls: the acting PC (Dexterity to inject/handle or INT if ritualized); roll appropriate stat pool.  
- Required successes for narrative effects (example):  
  - 1S — twitch, reflexes only (subject moves; can reveal small tactile clue)  
  - 2S — partial recall; subject speaks disjointed names/locations (usable clue)  
  - 3S — coherent short-term recall (up to 2 minutes of lucid speech)  
  - 4S+ — extended lucidity or stronger effect (rare; high cost)
- Fail: the subject convulses; lose 1–2 Con for the administering PC; unexpected mutation or instant degradation may occur (see madness table).

3) Containment / Follow‑up Check
- Who rolls: the team (one player rolls INT/SENSE) to secure the subject and extract information. Combined team actions (multiple players contributing) may add extra dice.  
- Success yields usable testimony; failure risks the subject lashing out, escape, or dying again without useful info.

Notes on combined successes: allow group pooling — e.g., if two players each achieve 1S in coordinated actions, treat as a 2S team success.

## Madness & Side Effects (narrative table)
After revival (successful or failed), roll SPIRIT or have the player roll d6 and consult the table for immediate mental effects. These are roleplay-first consequences; mechanical effects should align with your campaign rules (Con loss, temporary penalties, long-term trauma). Use the result that best serves drama.

Roll d6 (or pick by GM):
1 — Quiet Unraveling: Subject whispers fragments, drifts into catatonia after 1 minute. (Effect: loses coherent recall; +1 Trauma tag.)
2 — Memory Shards: Subject recalls a single vivid memory that is emotionally wrenching but incomplete. (Effect: useful clue + guilt/trauma tag.)
3 — Paranoia Spike: Subject accuses random NPCs; may name an unlikely ally or a false lead. (Effect: misdirection risk.)
4 — Visions & Names: Subject reveals cryptic names/locations — valuable but warped; they may also say a phrase that haunts players. (Effect: plot hook + 1 Insomnia tag.)
5 — Aggressive Return: Subject lashes out, physical danger; may become a chase/encounter. (Effect: combat or containment scene.)
6 — Echoed Personality: Subject briefly returns to old self with lucidity and clarity — then collapses into madness later (powerful clue, heavy cost). (Effect: major clue + lasting trauma for witnesses.)

Longer-term consequences
- Repeated use on connected NPCs increases city suspicion, attracts factions, and may produce lingering supernatural echoes (haunting, recurring visions, or NPCs becoming conduits to time‑rifts).

## Potency tiers (narrative scale)
- Tier 0 — Trace: tiny effect; useful only for forensic residue.  
- Tier 1 — Standard: short twitch → 1–2 usable clues; 1–2 Con cost on failure.  
- Tier 2 — Potent: up to 2 minutes of coherent speech; higher madness risk; costs resources.  
- Tier 3 — Cataclysmic: extended lucidity or permanent changes; high chance of severe madness or mutation. Reserve for major story beats.

## Safe GM guidance & ethics beats
- Use Reanimation Fluid as a dramatic lever, not a trivial tool. Make players pay a cost (social, moral, resource).  
- Emphasize consequences: townsfolk, clergy, and law view reanimation with horror — scenes may provoke riots, arrests, or factional interest.  
- Tie to Herbert’s arc: each success pushes him farther into obsession; each failure costs him sanity or allies.

## Plot hooks & complications
- A rival (Black Veil / rival scientist) steals a batch and weaponizes it; the PCs must recover or contain it.  
- An NPC revived briefly reveals a hidden ledger page or the name of a bank account — but the memory is warped and must be corroborated.  
- A repeat subject becomes a beacon for a time‑rift; odd phenomena follow the experiment.

## Example (fictional, non-technical) — "Herbert's Batch #7"
- Narrative: Batch #7 combined a heavy Time‑Salt tincture with Nocturne Wax and a cultured slurry; it revived an old sailor for three minutes. He spoke of the "NINTH BELL" and named an auction house before collapsing into screaming visions. The town suspected witchery; a Bluecoat inquiry began.
- Mechanical: Stabilization roll (Herbert INT) = 3S → Potent. Administration roll (assistant DEX) = 2S → partial recall. Madness roll = 6 (Echoed Personality) → major clue but lasting trauma.

## Running this in play
- Keep checks fast and narratively focused (1–3 rolls).  
- Reward players who cooperate: combined successes, shared skill use, and roleplay trades.  
- Use the madness table to create new scenes rather than punish players — each result is an opportunity for story.

If you want, I can:
- Produce three named sample batches with distinct narrative outcomes (short case notes).  
- Create an NPC file for Herbert with sanity ticks, motives, and sample lines.  
- Convert the madness table into a printable handout for the table.
