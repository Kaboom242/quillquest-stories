Session 1
Idea 1: The Auction []
The story begins with a rumor spreading through the seedy underbelly of Victoria: an artifact ( A normal item from 1980s America)  is being auctioned off by one of the city's most notorious criminal lords [Name, and goals]. As well as a captured person on interest a Wander (Mad Scientist) Each player has their own reason for seeking out this artifact.
During the auction (held in a crumbling mansion), chaos erupts. The Eastern Trading Company, seeking to claim the artifact for themselves. In the confusion, the players are forced to band together to survive. The artifact ends up in their possession, and they discover its time-traveling potential.
Driving Force: They are now targets of multiple factions who want the artifact, forcing them to cooperate to survive and uncover its mysteries.
Murder at Blackthorn Manor
The city of Victoria is in an uproar over the shocking murder of a beloved public figure: Lord Reginald Blackthorn, the charismatic Speaker of the House. Known for his efforts to mediate between Victoria’s warring factions and reform the city’s corrupt institutions, his death sends ripples of chaos through high society and the criminal underworld alike.
The murder occurs during a lavish party at Blackthorn Manor, where the city’s elite and shadowy power players are gathered. In the heart of the chaos, a group of strangers is inexplicably brought together.

The Inciting Incident
As the murder unfolds:
The Clock tower strikes Midnight.
The Mad Scientist, Gladiator, and Cowboy are ripped out of their respective times and deposited directly into Lord Blackthorn’s study, the epicenter of the crime. Dazed and confused, they find themselves staring at an injured Lord Blackthorn, slumped against his desk, bleeding out.
At the same moment, the Detective, and Martial Artist, Thief, —each with their own reasons for searching the sprawling mansion—enter the study from opposite doors.
Thief: Climbing in Window, looking for valuables?
Detective: Searching for Records of the Conspiracy
Ninja: Looking for evidence of where your sister might be.
Lord Blackthorn, clutching a blood-streaked Book, gasps his final words:
"Take it... they must not get it..."
Before anyone can react further, footsteps echo in the hallway. The study door bursts open, revealing several party guests—city officials, nobles, and members of the press—who freeze at the sight of the strangers hunched over Blackthorn’s lifeless body.
A moment of stunned silence is followed by accusations and cries of alarm:
Captain Reginald Bramwell Sees Group and gives them a minute to 
"Murderers! Arrest them!"
Escape Options: Once the players decide to flee, they must navigate the sprawling halls of Blackthorn Manor. We are on the top fourth floor. The manor is a multi-level Victorian mansion filled with:
Ornate staircases
Gilded ballroom (full of panicking partygoers)
Darkened servant corridors
Hidden passageways or trapdoors
Guards block the main stairs, forcing players into the servant’s wing.
A panicked servant spills a tray of food, creating a slippery floor.
Escape Roots:
The Underground Wine Cellar: A hidden door leads to old smuggling tunnels beneath the manor. These tunnels are unguarded but dark and full of hazards (collapsed sections, rats, or even lurking foes).
The Rooftops: A trellis outside a second-story window provides access to the manor’s rooftop. Players must balance speed and stealth to climb down into the alleyways below without being seen.
The Main Gate: Heavily guarded but leads directly to the foggy city streets.
The Stakes and Driving Force
The group must flee the scene, pursued by Blackthorn’s security staff, city guards, and members of rival factions who see an opportunity to exploit the chaos. As fugitives, the strangers have no choice but to band together to uncover:
The True Culprit: Who orchestrated Blackthorn’s murder, and why?
The Ledger’s Secrets: Blackthorn’s dying words and the cryptic book he left behind hint at dangerous secrets—secrets worth killing for. The group must decipher its contents before their pursuers do.
Why Them?: The temporal Wanderers must also grapple with why they were brought to this specific moment. Is there a deeper connection between them, Blackthorn’s death, and the city of Victoria itself?

Blackthorn’s Diary
"To mediate peace between wolves and lions, one must become a wolf in sheep's clothing. The price of progress often demands blood, but whose blood shall it be?"
"The Crown yearns for its throne, yet their revolution would plunge us into ruin. I barter peace with words as sharp as swords, but each word tastes of treason."
"Harmony, they call it. Order, they promise. But where does harmony end and tyranny begin? Perhaps I have sold the city’s soul for stability."
"The wolves circle. Even those I trusted sharpen their knives.”
"Their methods are abhorrent, their ambitions monstrous. But what choice is left? Bringers of chaos; or bringers of chains. Perhaps in their darkness lies the city’s salvation—if only temporarily."
"The weaves of threads tighten around our throat. I must tread carefully, lest I become his next marionette."
"As the chorus of Parliament swells, the call for strength grows louder— yet I am lost in the tide.  Only by plunging under the waves and drowning with demons can the tides be changed."
Upon Deciphering the messages. You learn the Parliament had secret plans to drug the populous, a forbidden Alchemy. 


Chapter 1
Searching the crime Scene
The Black Veils are present.
Run in with the Smiling Men. 

Mac Dower’s Pawn Shop
Find Gold Emerald  (Halesworth Banker for Golden Penny)
The ball begins at the ninth chime of the clock tomorrow. Masks are mandatory.
The vault lies beneath the east wing, accessible only through the servant’s quarters.
Haleworth keeps a single key on his person. Stealing it will be your first task.
Quinn Was here.

The Golden Emerald
"The golden glow, you’ll never see,
A trinket lost, no guarantee.
For what you held was never yours,
Now it waits behind locked doors." - Quinn

On the back you see what looks like imprints of writing from another page. 
“...the drop off point for the Golden Emerald will be near an abandoned tannery in Blacktyre Canals.”

Int + sense (2)
You notice the emerald you have is made of green glass with golden lines drawn on. With a golden looking base glued on.  A forgery. 

You hear a commotion from upstairs “their gone search the house" - come with me let's check the vault. 
Progression of the Quest
Rumors and Leads
The players begin gathering information about Quinn, the Golden Emerald, and the factions involved. Possible avenues:
Taverns and Thieves: Talking to underworld contacts reveals that Quinn has recently been working closely with the Royal Faction. They suggest Quinn’s latest jobs focus on disrupting Parliament’s plans.
Haleworth’s Staff: Questioning servants or guards reveals Haleworth was pressured to sell the Emerald to Eleanor Malcairn, a Parliament official. One guard admits hearing whispers of "The Veil’s interests."
Feana’s Insights: If the players revisit Feana, she tells them the Emerald isn’t just a gem—it’s rumored to be a key tied to an ancient magic. 
The Blacktyre Canals Meeting
The players can stake out or crash Quinn’s meeting in Blacktyre Canals. Possible outcomes:
Observing from the Shadows: They see Quinn meeting with a Royal Faction operative, passing the Emerald to them in a sealed case. If they intervene, the operatives will fight or flee with the case.
Confronting Quinn: If the players engage Quinn directly, she’s witty and pragmatic. She explains she stole the Emerald for the Royals to keep it out of the Veil’s hands and offers to help them if their goals align.
Discovering a Trail: Searching the area after the meeting reveals more clues about the Emerald's next destination—a heavily fortified Royal safehouse or a secretive smuggler ship.
Breaking into the Patron’s Estate
Learning that Eleanor Malcairn was the intended buyer, the players may choose to investigate her estate or follow her trail:
Parliamentary Intrigue: Eleanor is hosting a lavish gathering, giving the players an opportunity to infiltrate her mansion to find proof of her connection to the Black Veil.
The Veil’s Secrets: In Eleanor’s study, they uncover documents showing Parliament’s secret plans to use the Emerald in a device called the "Temporal Anchor," which could give them control over time anomalies in the city.
The Emerald’s True Purpose
If the players retrieve the Emerald, they notice strange markings along its surface—ancient symbols.
The players must decide: deliver the Emerald to the Royals, destroy it to prevent its misuse, or use it themselves to potentially reshape Victoria’s future.

Complications and Twists
The Shadow Baron’s Intervention
The Shadow Baron learns of the players’ involvement and sends agents to intercept the Emerald. They attempt to bribe or threaten the players into handing it over.
Quinn’s True Allegiances
Quinn may not be entirely loyal to the Royals. If the players gain her trust, she reveals she’s playing both sides to ensure no one faction gains too much power. She might offer to join the party temporarily if their goals align.
The Royal Faction’s Motives
While the Royals claim to want the Emerald to stop Parliament, their true motive may be to use it to summon time-warped armies from the past to bolster their forces in the city.
The Emerald’s Curse
Using the Emerald triggers unforeseen consequences— Using it with Feana will send the players back to Ancient Rome.
Emerald’s Appearance
The Golden Emerald is a breathtakingly unique gemstone, its appearance so mesmerizing that it seems almost otherworldly. Unlike traditional emeralds with their deep green hues, this gem glimmers with a radiant golden-green brilliance, as if sunlight itself were captured within its crystalline depths.
Embedded within the depths of the stone are faint, swirling patterns that look almost alive. These internal "veins" seem to pulse or shift subtly when observed for long, lending the Emerald an almost hypnotic quality. Legends suggest these patterns are an ancient script or an encoded map, but no one has ever confirmed this.
The gem is encased in an ornate gold frame, designed not just as a setting but as a protective casing. The frame is a masterpiece of craftsmanship, featuring delicate filigree patterns of swirling vines and clockwork-like gears. Tiny engravings along the edges include a mix of runes and Roman numerals.
Holding the Emerald you feel a peculiar sensation: a faint hum at the edge of perception, almost like the ticking of a clock.

Silas Kane: “I've heard about your involvement in my brother's death. Executed with a bullet through the forehead. In a side ally, leaving the body for all the onlookers and scum of the city to see. At least you spared him the agony of a prolonged suffering. I suppose that much is worth acknowledging. But I am sorry to say, I don't plan to give you the same courtesy, I hope you find peace in your final moments, because I certainly won't be the one offering it.”

Strange omens have been appearing for weeks: statues bleeding, wells running dry, and the Emperor’s Estate shrouded in a dark maroon storm that seems unnatural. The citizens are uneasy, but no one dares speak openly about their fears. However, as the players wander the city, they overhear snippets of conversation:
A drunk soldier muttering about "the Rift" opening beneath the Colosseum.
Bleeding Statues
A merchant warning her children to stay indoors at night, saying, "The old gods are angry."
A priest speaking in hushed tones about sacrifices being made in secret to appease a "sleeping god."
The players soon realize that the earthquakes and tremors they felt upon arrival are just the beginning. The ground is unstable, and strange noises echo from below.

Basilisk, in the Sewer
Whispers have spread through the city of Rome: dead animals found near the sewers, bloated and blackened. No one dares investigate further—at least, no one who values their life. The stench of decay is overwhelming, a warning that something ancient and terrible stirs beneath the city.
The air down here is thick with noxious fumes, a suffocating blend of industrial rot, human waste, and something more sinister. The deeper you go, the worse it gets.
Resist Noxious Fumes, 2 Illness (Resist with Fort+1D) per 30 mins in the Sewers.
Can make Masks that reduce Illness Gained. +1S to Resist. (Cloth)
The sewers are an endless series of dark, tube-like passages supported by sturdy stone arches. The stone is slick and wet, the smell of decay and stagnant water a constant companion. Faint echoes of dripping water and distant, grinding machinery reverberate through the tunnels.
The Earth Shudders – Collapsing Arches
Suddenly, the ground shakes beneath your feet. A low rumble, followed by the distinct cracking sound of stone, splits the air. Perception Check
Chunks of stone and mortar fall around you, and the passage ahead is blocked. You hear another crack split through the air, this time coming from right above you.
Sprint Check: (Agl+Endr)x3 times
10 Space:  take 3S+4D dmg to Blast. 
12 Spaces: take 1S+4D Blast dmg. 
As you flee, more arches begin to crumble behind you, the entire tunnel network destabilizing. The only safe direction is down—a 45-degree sludge-filled chute ahead that leads into a dark, unknown chambrrrrrer. 
With little time to react, you’re forced to slide down the chute. The smell is overwhelming, the air thick with the stench of stagnant waste, rot, and something metallic. The slickness of the chute sends you tumbling into a deep, sludge-filled chamber.
As you land, you can feel the muck pulling at your clothes and boots. The chamber smells of old rot and stagnant water. The foul liquid is waist-deep, and the stench clings to you. You can catch your breath, but it’s clear that something is very wrong here. Floating around you in the sludge are pieces of woodr, bones, and other unmentionable filth.
Suddenly, you hear the sound of cracking stone to your right. Water begins to push through the cracks, as if the very walls are giving way. The water is rising, and quickly.
Intelligence (Investigation or Nature) to determine how the flow might be stopped (e.g., blocking a hidden valve or patching a specific crack).
Can use Strength to push stones into place,
You spot an iron grate along the ceiling of the chamber. A few of its bars are missing, enough for a person to squeeze through. The stone around the grate is worn and chipped, and climbing up is perilous, but there’s no other way out.
As you crawl through the grate, you notice something disturbing ahead. A dead man leans against a door. His face is twisted in agony, and his hand is outstretched toward the door’s handle. He seems to have been trying to close it. But the door is caught on something, a long smooth pillar of stone. It's poking up out of the water that floods the corridor.
Investigate the Stone Reveals it is a man's leg, but turned to stone.
Investigating the Dead man you find bloaty purple welts on his chest and legs. The veins on his arm are black, and there is a small bite wound. 
The Chamber of the Clockwork Heart and Basilisk
The final door gives way with a shriek of rusted metal as you pull yourselves into the chamber. At first, the room is eerily silent—oppressively so. Then, the low hum of machinery echoes faintly, like a distant heartbeat beneath the stone.
You stand within a vast subterranean hall, hidden deep beneath Rome. The air is heavy and damp, scented with mold, rust, and the faint electric tang of ozone. Shin-high water floods the floor, dark and still, disturbed only by the ripples of your movement. Reflections of flickering torchlight—or something else—dance across the black mirror surface.
The room is supported by immense marble pillars, spaced evenly in two rows, reaching up to a vaulted, arched ceiling veined with age and grime. The architecture speaks of old Roman grandeur—columns with faded carvings of gods and stars, now cracked and worn by time.
At the center of the chamber rises something entirely alien to this place: a gleaming metal device, pristine compared to its surroundings. It stands seven feet tall and six wide, an elegant fusion of brass, iron, and dark steel, shaped like a mechanical altar or generator. Pistons slowly thump in its base, creating rhythmic vibrations you feel in your bones. A series of interlocking gears and pressure gauges whirl and twitch, alive with restrained energy.
Its surface is embossed with inlaid gold runes, not quite Latin, not quite Greek—symbols older than either, pulsing faintly with reddish light.
A brass hatch sits on the front of the device, sealed with an ornate latch in the shape of an hourglass flanked by two snakes. 
All around the room, smaller mechanical arms slowly rotate and move on hydraulic pivots. Some rise into the air, others extend to the ground, tipped with tools or lenses. These were perhaps meant to maintain the machine—or to defend it.
Pipes hiss from above, and steam bursts from ceiling vents every so often, releasing a thin fog into the space. 
The Basilisk
In the corner of the room, a ripple of water echoes out, a chill runs down your spine. From the shadows, a Creature emerges. Its form is monstrous and small, only about 1 or 2 feet above the shin high water—standing upright like a twisted horror on two legs, long twisting neck. On its head a white “crown” of spines and boney plates gleaming in the dark. The creature’s eyes shimmer with sharp light, glowing faintly in the gloom.
It has a beak-like mouth and sharp, jagged teeth. The stone beneath its feet seems to decay, and as it moves, it leaves a trail of dead plant life in its wake. The toxic aura of its presence warps the air—plants wither where it passes, and even metal rusts faster in the air it breathes.
The Creature hisses echoes through the chamber, and as it opens its mouth, a wave of toxic mist billows forth, peeling the moss off the stone and burning the skin of anything it touches.
Staring into its eyes; Resist 3 Petrify Con Points (turn to illness after combat)
Toxic Aura: Radius of 30 feet. Plants wither, metal rusts faster, and any organic material corrodes.
The Broken Heart
As you lift the latch and pull open the hatch, a hiss of pressurized steam releases into the room, and inside, you see the heart of the machine.
Within the machine's core is a large mechanical clock, built into the housing like a sacred relic. Its glass face is cracked, and its ornate filigree hands are frozen—stuck firmly at 8:59. Every few seconds, the gears behind it twitch, as if trying to move, but something is preventing the motion—like a heartbeat arrested mid-throb.
Next to the clock is a transference chamber, ringed with silver filaments and copper conduits, designed to focus and channel energy. Arcs of crackling electricity leap from one conductor to the next in short bursts. Inside the chamber, mounted on a delicate-looking bracket, is a broken crystal shard, blackened and split.rrrrrr
Powered Heart
The device roars to life as the time strikes 9 o’clock. The once-frozen second hand trembles—then jolts forward with a sharp tick, spinning wildly as if making up for lost time. The entire machine hums with renewed vigor, gears churning, pumps firing in perfect sequence.
Then—
GONG.
A deep, resonant chime echoes through the chamber.
GONG.
Another.
Nine in total. Each one heavier, louder, like the heartbeat of a titan stirring from slumber.
As the final chime reverberates off the stone walls, electricity surges through the exposed copper filaments. The energy coils around the crystal like a serpent and strikes it with a thunderous flash. The shard bursts into blinding white light, pulsing now—alive again, thrumming with ancient, forgotten power.
The floodwater around the base vibrates, rings expanding outward. From the machine’s seams and valves, beams of pale gold light lance out, racing up the pillars, vanishing into the piping that disappears into the darkness beyond. The air crackles.
The machine has awakened.
But something is wrong.
As the ninth chime fades, the hands of the clock twitch—and then explode outward, spinning off with a screech of metal and a burst of glass. The chamber is filled with a rain of glittering shards.
To your left, a massive gear slips its track, letting out a deafening metallic clang as it crashes somewhere deep inside the device. The hum turns into a howl, and the once-precise movements of the pistons now thrash erratically.
Steam bursts from the seams in violent jets, filling the room with scalding mist. The machine shudders like a beast in pain, beginning to tear itself apart from within.
This miracle of ancient industry—awakened for a single, glorious moment—is now dying.
And the chamber grows hot, loud, and unstable.
A pipe bursts from above light filtering through the haze as the pipe creates a ladder upwards. 
Harpies in the Fields
Once golden with ripening wheat, the farmlands beyond Rome are now a wasteland. Ash drifts through the air like dying snow. Smoke coils from smoldering crops, painting the horizon in sickly hues of gray and red.
The wind carries the scent of scorched earth and something fouler—carrion left to rot under the sun.
Bloodied plow tools lie discarded where farmers fell, handles snapped, blades bent. Homes that once bustled with life now sit shuttered and silent, their windows dark, their doors bolted. From within, frightened eyes sometimes peek, only to vanish again with the soft creak of wood.
Scattered throughout the fields are the fallen.
Some lie twisted and crumpled, chests caved in, ribs shattered inward from high-velocity impacts—as though dropped from great heights.
Others bear deep gashes across their backs, necks, and faces, wounds torn open by talons or claws, skin flayed by air-danced fury.
Flies buzz low over the bodies, but none dare land. The ground around them seems cursed, brittle and wrong.
Then come the shadows. Large, swift-moving blots flit across the fields. When you glance skyward, you see — dark shapes circling high above like vultures made of sinew and hate. Their wings beat the air with a sound like cracking sails, their cries shrill and unnatural, echoing across the plains.
A few survivors huddle in ditches or under overturned carts, too afraid to move or speak.
As you near the Rift, the earth begins to tremble faintly beneath your feet. A heatless wind rises, pulling at your clothes and whispering in tongues that do not belong in this world.
Then, with a rush of air and the scream of a dying gale, black shadows descend from the sky. The harpies are coming.
Their wings outstretched, eyes burning with cruel intelligence, they fall like spears—ready to rend, to snatch, to tear apart what dares tread near the underworld’s scar.
In the Rift
The rift yawns wide—a black, smoking chasm in the earth. As you descend, light is swallowed by the dense, acrid smog. The air tastes of burning carbon, like cigar smoke steeped in sulfur. It clings to your throat, coats your tongue, and bites at your eyes.
Deeper still, the ground gives way to thick iron pipes erupting from the stone like veins of a mechanical beast. Iron catwalks stretch out beneath your feet, slick with condensation and soot. The oppressive silence is broken only by the rising hum of distant machinery. A low, rhythmic clanking begins to echo through the darkness.
The industrial heartbeat grows louder—massive greased gears churn slowly in the gloom, pistons hiss and hammer in sequence, steam bursts from pressure valves with sudden, angry force. The entire place breathes like a giant engine.
Through the swirling fog and the maze of pipes, a figure flickers into view—shrouded in a black veil, utterly silent. It glides across a catwalk and vanishes behind a towering iron furnace, leaving only a faint trail in the steam.
As you press on, the pipeways twist into a labyrinth, you hear a growing gong, gong, gong. A deep ringing sound coming from up head. . Finally, you emerge into a circular chamber—a cathedral of machinery. At its center stands a great clock face set into the floor, its massive second hand sweeping the room at chest height. You must time your steps to avoid it.
In the middle of the chamber, a glass containment tube stands upright, humming faintly. A small slot at its base seems shaped for a gem or crystal. Every sixty seconds, a pulse of raw energy surges through the lens at its core, blasting upward like lightning to strike the ceiling. In response, power ripples outward—pipes rattle, gears groan, and the entire complex roars to life once more.
Every 4 Rounds, a Crystal is interrupting the Energy Wave 2 Black Veil Guards enter and try to stop you. Crystal Charges 1S+3D every 4 Rounds. At 4S the machinery Stops, and the machines begin to fall apart.

Last wave man shows up with Fea as a hostage, telling the group to back away from the machine or she dies.
Return From Rome
You are moving, but not in space, you are tumbling down, as you fall, you feel a pressure wave reverberate through you, as if a deep chime was rung on the largest bell ever made, As you fall you hear and feel the ringing of this deep bell, 9 times.  With its final ring, space twists and twirls to be normal once more, you are inside a large machine of some kind.   The room you are in feels like an upside down Clock Tower, as you gaze upwards it feels like you are looking down a large tower, your stomach twists and turns as a sense of unease and vertigo mix.
The Upside Down Tower
Lying motionless in front of you lays the body draped in a black veil. The body of a woman. She lays dead below a massive bell, with carvings of IX around its bottom. As you step forward, you see In her hands an hourglass, shattered, leaking silver sand. There is an incense all but fizzled out near her head, smells of Myrrh, Blue Lotus, and Belladonna
 "Veilsmoke" -  A ritual incense blend: Blue Lotus, Myrrh, Mugwort, and Henbane flowers. Said to bind the soul to the body for nine breaths after death.
upon Lifting her Veil: She appears to be of Greek or Roman birth.  Her face and body are young and beautiful, half aged and old. Half her head has white hair, while the other half is silky brown. 
Cause of death = shock / heart attack likely due to the half aging.
Ringing the bell flips the room right side up and you can descend the tower


2 Weeks have past, the search for your group has gone cold.  

The Murder on the Sundial
You receive a mysterious note written in Chief Clarence Wainwright’s handwriting, slipped into your hands. The note reads:
"Detective Ronald, You’ve been wronged. I can help clear your name, and mine too. People think there is a mole in the ranks of blue. Meet me in the Ashgrove Greens by the sundial at the ninth chime of the clock tonight.  I know the truth about their schemes. I’ll be unarmed and alone. -- C.W. 
"
Anagrams, sundial, black veil
Victoria is the after life and all your characters are dead exploring worlds that died. 
The Scene:
When Ronald arrives at the Great Gardens, the area is eerily quiet. The centerpiece of the garden is a grand sundial, surrounded by manicured hedges and winding stone paths. Clarence’s body is slumped over the sundial, a deep wound staining his uniform with crimson. Clutched in his hand is a torn piece of parchment, and beside him, a broken stopwatch glints in the moonlight.
Clues Found on Clarence:
The Torn Parchment: In his pocket lays a pad with notes he has jotted down. written in Clarence’s handwriting:
"The parliament’s plan moves with the chimes. The ninth bell brings order. What are they planning? 
Something Scribbled out. 
The Veil is everywhere. They know more than they should.
 Stormbell. Clockmakers.  Royal Archives = MT"
The Stopwatch: Broken at exactly 9:00, with faint scratches on the back reading, "Time always betrays us." 
Key engraved with the initials "M.T." Key looks the glimmer light gold and has the Symbol for Golden Penny on the other side.

Progression and Threads:
1. The Killer’s Escape
A quick investigation of the area reveals signs of struggle: overturned garden furniture, blood splatters leading into the hedge maze, and a faint trail of footprints in the dew. Following the trail could lead to a confrontation with an assassin or a dead end, depending on the players’ skills.
2. The Parliament Connection
The torn parchment hints at a connection to Parliament’s secretive operations and the Black Veil. Ronald, if present, may piece together that Clarence was attempting to expose a conspiracy tied to the brainwashed citizens or mind-control experiments.
3. The Key’s Significance
Research in the Archives for a MT
A fence, informer, or another NPC familiar with the underbelly (like Faena) recognizes the "M.T." initials and recalls that Malcolm Tremont was once involved in covert dealings with Parliament. (The contact demands payment, a favor, or help dealing with a rival faction before they reveal the information.)
Talk to the Clockmakers.  Clockmakers are cautious, suspicious of strangers, or even paid to stay silent. The players must navigate suspicions or win the trust of a craftsman to learn about Tremont’s workshop and legacy.

The key labeled “M.T.” leads to a safe deposit box in the Golden Penny Bank. Retrieving its contents requires clever thinking, as the area is heavily patrolled by the police. 
4. The Stopwatch’s Mystery
The broken stopwatch appears mundane, but a successful investigation reveals it was tampered with. Someone wanted it to break at the ninth chime—symbolic of time being manipulated. Could this be a message from Clarence or the Ninthbell Order?

The Golden Penny Bank is a vaulted cathedral of finance, full of stained glass depicting coin-bearing angels and echoing marble floors. The Golden Penny insignia—a crowned coin—is carved into every surface. The bank is open during daylight hours, but the safety deposit vaults are strictly guarded by private security and bank-cleric agents sworn to the Parliament.
Access to boxes requires a key and the client’s unique coin stamp (or a forged one).
