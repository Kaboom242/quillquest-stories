## NOTES ON CHECKS (apply to all scenes)
- Resolution: roll a pool of d6 equal to (Stat dice + class/ability mods + situational +XD). Count 5s and 6s as Successes.
- Required Successes: each check lists required successes (e.g., 1S = informational clue, 2S = clear reveal, 3S = full disclosure). On success follow the success outcome. On failure apply the fail consequence and follow the indicated next step.
- Fail consequences: often cost Constitution points (Con), lose time (opportunity cost), or trigger a complication (raise alert or spawn a patrol). When a fail says "lose Con", deduct the stated Con points and apply any immediate mechanical effect (slower Pace, -1 to next roll, etc.).

## Scene 1 — Hollowspire Cathedral (50 min)

**Scene context (why players are here)**
Sister Calra Mourn owes £2,000 to the Syndicate for orphanage renovation costs. She's been paying through redirected church donations but has refused "nonstandard transaction" payments — the implication being sexual favors. The players know she's vulnerable but principled, making her a potential ally if approached with sensitivity. The cathedral is a public space but confession records are private — players need to establish trust or find another angle.

**Environmental setup**
Cold wax smell, distant bell tolls, nervous parishioners. Sister Calra appears withdrawn and fearful; Father Aled (priest) watches strangers carefully; Sexton Jory sweeps but listens to conversations. There's an underlying tension in the cathedral — regular parishioners seem to be avoiding certain areas.

**Primary approach options (logical player choices)**

1) **Direct social approach** — Ask Sister Calra politely for help
- Why this works: she's desperate for legitimate protection; respectful approach may earn trust
- Check: CHA pool. 1S = brief private conversation; 2S = offers to share ledger page; 3S = volunteers courier info + personal situation
- Fail (0S): she refuses fearfully and asks you to leave; Father Aled becomes suspicious (attention +1)

2) **Confession booth strategy** — Use confession to gain private access
- Why this works: confession is private; she's bound to listen; may open up about her situation
- Check: roleplay or CHA pool for trust-building. 1S = she listens; 2S = offers practical help; 3S = reveals "nonstandard payment" pressure
- Risk: Father Aled may interrupt if suspicious behavior noticed

3) **Protection offer** — Promise to help with her Syndicate problem
- Why this works: she desperately needs protection from escalating pressure
- Check: CHA + commitment level. 1S = she's interested; 2S = shares details; 3S = full cooperation + ongoing alliance
- Risk: requires following through; expensive commitment (protection services)

4) **Distraction + search** — One player distracts while others search
- Why this works: ledgers are kept in the vestry; distraction splits attention
- Requires: coordinated action (Jericho CHA distraction + others DEX/SENSE search)
- Check: Combined 3S total across players within 5 minutes
- Risk: if caught, Father Aled calls Bluecoats (+patrol, forced exit)

**Information gathering (what's available here)**
- Ledger contains: £2,000 debt for "Orphanage Renovation Project", payment record showing redirected church donations, courier name (Fran Burk), drop location cipher "Obsidian — Pine Wharf"
- Physical evidence: boot prints, torn receipt fragments, valet tokens hidden in statues
- Sister Calra knows: courier schedule (midnight), Syndicate pressure tactics, refused "nonstandard transactions", Parliamentary connection through church hierarchy
- Personal situation: She's being pressured for sexual favors to reduce debt but has refused all such offers

**Player action integration (during any approach)**
- Gaius: sensory sweep (SENSE pool, 1S) — spots foreman's boot print linking to ledger names
- Billy: pew search (DEX pool, 1S) — finds slipped crate label with Pine Wharf timing
- Ronald: evidence organization (INT pool, 1S) — correlates forged invoice to MP aide
- Tempii: pickpocket opportunity (DEX pool, 1S) — steals valet token; sharing with group = 2S intel
- Jericho: crowd work (CHA pool, 1S) — creates useful distraction or rallies support
- Herbert: residue analysis (INT pool, 1S) — detects rad-dust; useful for Greaves later

**Consequences & complications**
- Success outcomes: courier name + time, ledger fragment showing debt details, political connection revealed, potential ongoing ally
- Failure costs: 1 Con (stress), 10 minutes lost, Bluecoat patrol chance
- Escalation: loud disturbance attracts Father Aled or external attention
- Moral consideration: if players learn about sexual pressure, how they respond affects Sister Calra's trust and future cooperation

**Logical next steps based on player choices**
- If courier info gained: players can choose to stake out Pine Wharf or follow other leads first
- If political connection found: direct approach to Parliament becomes viable
- If only partial info: players need corroborating evidence from other sources

## Scene 2 — Professor Greaves (Ravensreach Heights) (65–75 min) — PRIMARY INTEREST

**Scene context (why players go here and what they expect)**
Greaves is an academic who owes money to the Syndicate. He's been doing excavation work under Parliament and has maps showing hidden chambers. He hosts small academic salons and donor meetings, explaining why he uses invitations. Players likely approach after being told he has maps or being refused at other locations.

**Environmental setup**
Well-appointed manor in wealthy district. Marian (maid) answers door, suspicious of unannounced visitors. Greaves is in his study with excavation materials. Steward (groundskeeper) patrols grounds. Neighbors are alert to unusual activity.

**Door approach options (logical first choices)**

1) **Polite visitor approach** — Present as interested academics/investors
- Why this works: Greaves hosts academic visitors; plausible cover
- Check: CHA pool. 1S = parlor waiting (brief interview); 2S = study access; 3S = private time
- Fail: Marian refuses; calls steward if players persist

2) **Forged invitation strategy** — Create fake invitation to salon
- Why this works: Greaves uses printed invitations for events; forgeable
- Requires: INT + DEX check (2S for convincing forgery)
- Bonus: if players ask for sample invitation text, provide +1D to forgery
- Risk: Marian knows guest lists; may ask for verification

3) **Bribe or leverage** — Offer payment or hint at protection from Syndicate
- Why this works: household needs money; staff aware of financial pressure
- Check: CHA + resource. Success varies by offer (coin vs. protection promise)
- Risk: insulting low offers anger staff; high offers draw attention

4) **Wait and observe** — Stake out to find entry opportunity
- Why this works: academic visitors come and go; timing windows exist
- Check: SENSE + patience. 1S = visitor pattern noted; 2S = entry window found
- Time cost: 30-60 minutes; may miss other leads

**If door approaches fail — Break-in options**

5) **Coordinated break-in** — Multiple players work together
- Why players choose this: other approaches failed; evidence is time-sensitive
- Requires: AGL pool (quiet approach) + DEX pool (window/lock) = 3S total between 2+ players
- No-split rule: requires minimum two players with different skills
- Risk: 0-1S = alarm raised; 2S = noisy entry (steward search in 3 minutes)

6) **Distraction + infiltration** — Split attention between front and back
- How it works: one player talks to Marian while others slip in rear
- Check: CHA distraction + AGL infiltration (both must succeed)
- Risk: if distraction fails, infiltrators are caught in compromising position

**Inside the study (what players can find)**
- Excavation maps showing Parliament tunnels, chamber marked "NINTH BELL"
- Disposal letters referencing "discreet removal" and auction houses
- Financial records showing debt payments and pressure
- Research notes on temporal artifacts and unusual findings

**Information extraction from Greaves**
- Nervous academic; protective of work but scared of Syndicate
- Will share maps if: convinced players can protect him, paid sufficiently, or shown evidence they're investigating Syndicate
- Bargaining check: CHA pool, 2S for map sharing + cooperation
- Fail: asks for 50G payment or insurance of safety

**Player action integration (simultaneous activities)**
- Gaius: classical symbol recognition (INT/SENSE, 1S) — links excavation marks to organized labor
- Billy: shipping manifest analysis (SENSE/DEX, 1S) — finds dock routes connecting to Captain Dorne
- Ronald: political connection (INT, 1S) — identifies MP aide connection for future leverage
- Tempii: pocket Marian's gossip slip (DEX, 1S) — cabinet key or intel; share for 2S value
- Jericho: servant wing distraction (CHA, 1S) — buys search time for team
- Herbert: margin residue study (INT, 1S) — rad-dust grants +1D to map decode if revealed

**Time pressure & consequences**
- Social access expires: Greaves vouches for limited time (15 minutes)
- Steward rounds: triggered by noise or failed checks (3-5 minute warning)
- Neighbor awareness: repeated visits or loud activity draws attention

**Complications & escalations**
- Parliamentary aide arrives unexpectedly — hide evidence or face confiscation
- Greaves panic-sells map to fence if spooked — creates chase scene to recover
- Steward confrontation — intimidation vs. escape vs. explanation

**Logical outcomes and next steps**
- Full success: map + disposal letter = direct route to Parliament chamber or auction lead
- Partial success: either map or letter = need corroboration from other sources
- Failure: investigation blocked; must find alternative route or pay higher price

## Scene 3 — Ravensreach Manor District / Pine Wharf Intercept (40–50 min)

**Scene context (why players end up here)**
Players need corroborating evidence or have specific leads pointing to servant networks (stewards, valets) or the Pine Wharf courier drop. This scene provides backup intel if other scenes failed, or serves as the crucial third piece of evidence.

**Location options based on player choices**

**Option A: Manor servant investigation** (if players choose to follow social leads)
- Target: Sir Alton Wexley or Lady Catriona Braye's household staff
- Why this works: servants know payment schedules and see courier activity
- Entry: servant quarter visits, staff area infiltration, or steward interviews

**Option B: Pine Wharf stakeout** (if players have courier info from Cathedral)
- Target: intercept Fran Burk or courier package at midnight
- Why this works: Sister Calra provided time and location; direct action approach
- Challenge: timing, stealth, and potential confrontation with courier or guards

**Servant investigation approach (Option A)**
1) **Gossip gathering** — Chat with off-duty staff at local taverns
- Check: CHA pool. 1S = steward name; 2S = access to servant ledgers
- Time: 20-30 minutes; may miss Pine Wharf window

2) **Direct staff approach** — Visit servant quarters with cover story
- Check: Deception + CHA. Success varies by story quality
- Risk: household security; questions about identity

3) **Steward bribery/pressure** — Direct approach to household steward
- Check: CHA + leverage (coin, threats, or protection offer)
- High-reward option: steward confession provides bank details

**Pine Wharf intercept approach (Option B)**
1) **Stealth observation** — Watch and gather intel without confrontation
- Check: AGL + SENSE (team effort). 3S total for clean intelligence gathering
- Reward: courier schedule, package contents hint, bank receipt recovery

2) **Direct intercept** — Confront courier and demand package
- Check: CHA intimidation or AGL surprise. Risk of combat escalation
- Reward: trunk/ledger contents but blown cover (Syndicate awareness +1)

3) **Swap/theft approach** — Replace real package with fake
- Requires: DEX + preparation time. Complex but clean if successful
- Team effort: multiple players needed for timing and execution

**Player action integration (coordinated efforts)**
- Gaius: physical tasks requiring strength (STR/DEX, 1S) — needs partner for locker opening
- Billy: dock/shipping expertise (SENSE/DEX, 1S) — identifies cargo timing requiring team lift
- Ronald: interrogation skills (INT/CHA, 1S) — steward confession more effective with evidence backup
- Tempii: theft opportunities (DEX, 1S) — stolen rings/tokens require group auction knowledge
- Jericho: distraction leadership (CHA, 1S) — coordinates team diversion for stealth advantage
- Herbert: evidence analysis (INT, 1S) — receipt residue links require map context from Greaves

**Timing and coordination challenges**
- Pine Wharf window: midnight deadline creates time pressure if players delayed
- Multiple approaches: players can split between manor and wharf but risk missing coordination
- Resource management: failed approaches consume time and may force less optimal backup plans

**Consequences & complications**
- Success: bank receipt (Violet Bank acct 41-C) + courier testimony OR steward confession + household ledger
- Partial success: one piece of evidence but courier/steward alerted to investigation
- Failure: courier escapes but drops partial intel; steward clams up but household security increases

**No-split enforcement mechanics**
- Physical challenges require two-player coordination (heavy lifting, complex timing)
- Momentum system: solo ventures cost party tokens; group actions generate bonus tokens
- Information sharing: private discoveries only valuable when brought back to group

## Combined Evidence & Decision Point (10 min)

**Evidence evaluation (what players need to proceed)**
Players need at least 2 of 3 evidence types:
1) Ledger fragment with courier info (Cathedral success)
2) Map showing Parliament chamber location (Greaves success)  
3) Financial trail to specific accounts (Manor/Wharf success)

**Decision matrix based on evidence gathered**
- **Ledger + Map**: Direct approach to Parliament chamber via tunnel access
- **Ledger + Financial**: Bank pressure or public exposure route with MP ally
- **Map + Financial**: Covert infiltration with political backup plan
- **All three**: Multiple route options; players choose risk/reward level
- **Less than two**: Syndicate suspicion raised; harder approaches required next session

**Immediate next steps (player choice)**
1) **Political route**: Approach friendly MP with evidence for official investigation
2) **Heist route**: Direct infiltration of bank or Parliament chamber  
3) **Social route**: Use evidence to pressure Crowl into voluntary meeting
4) **Delay route**: Gather more evidence but risk Syndicate counter-moves

---

## GM Guidance & Adaptation

**If players go off-script**
- **Bypass scenes**: Allow creative solutions but maintain evidence requirements
- **Alternative targets**: Redirect failed scenes to equivalent information sources
- **Time management**: Compress scenes if players move efficiently; expand if they struggle

**Maintaining group cohesion**
- **Private DM notes**: Always tie individual discoveries to group benefits
- **Spotlight rotation**: Ask direct questions to quiet players every 5 minutes
- **Shared challenges**: Require multiple skill types for major successes

**Pacing adjustments**
- **Fast groups**: Add complications or deeper investigation layers
- **Slow groups**: Offer binary choices and helpful NPCs to speed decisions
- **Stuck groups**: Provide clear cost/benefit analysis for available options

**Next session preparation based on outcomes**
- **High success**: Syndicate responds with counter-investigation or direct pressure
- **Moderate success**: Additional evidence gathering required under increased scrutiny  
- **Low success**: Forced into riskier approaches with higher stakes
