# The Name Game — Following the Leads (Investigate Leads)

## Purpose
Get a credible lead that opens a safe path to request a meeting with Bastien Crowl without tipping him off; train shared spotlight and group-first play.

## Length
180 minutes

---

NOTES ON CHECKS (apply to all scenes)
- Resolution: roll a pool of d6 equal to (Stat dice + class/ability mods + situational +XD). Count 5s and 6s as Successes.
- Required Successes: each check lists required successes (e.g., 1S = informational clue, 2S = clear reveal, 3S = full disclosure). On success follow the success outcome. On failure apply the fail consequence and follow the indicated next step.
- Fail consequences: often cost Constitution points (Con), lose time (opportunity cost), or trigger a complication (raise alert or spawn a patrol). When a fail says "lose Con", deduct the stated Con points and apply any immediate mechanical effect (slower Pace, -1 to next roll, etc.).

## Player-focused Goals (blended into scenes)
- Goals are now actionable: each scene below maps one or more concrete opportunities for each player to achieve their goal—use these as prompted beats rather than separate checklist items.

---

## Scene 1 — Hollowspire Cathedral (50 min)

Goal (what this scene advances)
- Establish a concrete courier lead (Fran Burk / Pine Wharf) and surface the first corroborating ledger evidence while training the table to act as a team.

How the scene plays out (flow + interleaved player actions)
1. Arrival & Framing (5 min)
- GM opener: "Cold wax and candle smoke. A bell tolls in the distance. Sister Calra waits behind a screen; the sexton eyes strangers." Invite a quick group paragraph of what each PC notices (30s each max) to spotlight quieter players.
- Mechanical note: this is a narrative warm-up—no roll unless a player insists on a specific action.

2. Secure access (5–10 min)
- What to do: gain private time with Sister Calra. Options: polite social approach, quiet distraction, or small bribery.
- Checks (D6 success system): roll CHA pool (CHA + mods + situational).
  - 1 Success (1S): private audience granted (you can ask 1 question / inspect 1 item).  
  - 2S: Sister Calra offers trust — you may request a copied ledger page.  
  - 0S (fail): she refuses; party loses 1 Con from stress and attention increases (Bluecoat chance +GM). Time cost: 10 minutes.
- Combined action: if Jericho attempts a short speech (CHA pool) to warm the room, and another player (Gaius or Ronald) performs a small sensory search (SENSE pool) during it, treat their rolls as simultaneous—success on either helps lower the required CHA for access by -1S.

3. Ledger inspection & decode (15–20 min)
- What to do: read ledger, find payments, and spot marginal cipher. Players can divide tasks: one reads, one cross-references names aloud, one searches the room for physical tokens.
- Primary check: INT + SENSE pool (roll together or in sequence). Outcomes by successes:
  - 1S: amounts and recipient names visible (basic lead).  
  - 2S: partial cipher fragment found (e.g., "Obsidian — Pine Wharf").  
  - 3S: cipher key or clear marginal note recovered (Caesar +2 hint) and a courier name (Fran Burk) with a time.
- Parallel player actions during inspection (weave into narration):
  - Gaius (SENSE): low-key sensory scan — 1S finds a foreman’s boot print or a unique scuff that links to a foreman name in the ledger. This converts to 1S credit toward ledger decode if reported to the group.  
  - Billy (DEX/Investigation): searches pews — 1S finds a slipped label with a Pine Wharf drop time. Adds 1S to overall scene intel when shared.  
  - Ronald (INT/Organize): spends a turn organizing names and ledger items aloud — 1S lets him point to a forged invoice entry that references a Parliamentary aide (gives a social lever).  
  - Tempii (DEX/Pickpocket): can pocket a valet token — 1S yields a token that names an auction house; turning it over to the group converts it into 2S usable intel.  
  - Jericho (CHA/Distract): stage a soft distraction—1S lowers the priestly guard chance; 2S grants Sister Calra's private confidence.  
  - Herbert (INT/Study): examine residue — 1S detects faint rad-dust; presenting this later to Greaves grants +1D on a map decode.

4. Roleplay & trade (5–10 min)
- If players earned 2S+ combined, Sister Calra will offer a copied page or name a courier (Fran Burk) and a time (midnight). If they only have 1S combined, she offers a rumor only (dead end unless followed).  
- If players negotiate (CHA pool) and succeed (1–2S depending on intent), Sister Calra may demand a small favor (protect her parish, deliver a note) — this creates a low-stakes side objective that teaches cooperative decision-making.

5. Exit & immediate decision (2–5 min)
- Present the found clues and ask the table to decide: stakeout Pine Wharf at midnight or follow Professor Greaves immediately. If the group wants Greaves now, offer a trade: present the ledger copy + Herbert's residue to fast-track Scene 2.

Revelations vs Dead-ends (what the players can learn here)
- Revelations (success outcomes)
  - Courier identified (Fran Burk) + Pine Wharf drop time — concrete stakeout lead.  
  - Cipher fragment with "Obsidian — Pine Wharf" and Caesar hint — cryptic but actionable.  
  - Physical tokens (valet token, crate label, foreman’s scuff) that connect ledger names to local locations or NPCs.
  
- Dead-ends / partials (fail outcomes)
  - Misread ledger entry becomes a red herring (costs 10 minutes and 1 Con).  
  - Sister Calra refuses to help (0S), requiring a different route or small favor payment (time/resource cost).  
  - Bluecoat attention spikes — increases stealth DCs in the following scenes.

Checks and what to roll (quick reference)
- Social access: CHA pool — 1S access / 2S trust+copy / 0S fail (1 Con + time).  
- Ledger read: INT + SENSE pool — 1S names/amounts / 2S fragment / 3S key + courier name.  
- Pickpocket/token: DEX pool — 1S valet token or label; sharing converts to more usable successes.  
- Sensory scan: SENSE pool — 1S physical clue (boot print, scuff).  
- Distraction: CHA pool — 1S reduces guard attention; 2S grants direct private time.

Fail consequences and follow-ups (what happens when checks fail)
- Mechanical effects: lose 1 Con (stress/dust), lose 10 minutes (opportunity cost), raise patrol level (+1 to stealth DCs next scenes), or trigger a side complication (acolyte alerts a Bluecoat).
- GM guidance: on a failure, offer a trade: a small micro-task (run an errand, bribe, or short diversion) that gets the players back on track but costs time/resources—this keeps momentum without railroading.

GM micro-prompts & roleplay hooks (copyable lines)
- To Sister Calra: "We don't want trouble—only the truth. If someone pays for protection, who signs for it?"  
- To a nervous sexton: "You said you saw a man in a dark coat near the wharf last week? Describe him again."  
- To the group when a clue is found: "You find a torn corner of a ledger with the words 'Obsidian' and 'Pine' — what do you do now?"

Keeping the scene moving and keeping Ronald/Tempii group-facing
- Private DM trade: if Ronald or Tempii ask for a private lead, send a 1–2 sentence DM that offers a micro-clue only if they promise to bring it back and spend one minute presenting it to the group (tie private gain to group return).

Time pacing tips
- If players spend too long: after 20 minutes of rolling/talking, offer a binary nudge ("Trade 50G or persuade with 2S Deception").  
- If players push Greaves early: allow immediate trade (Sister Calra's copy + Herbert residue) to fast-track Scene 2 but at the cost of losing the Pine Wharf witness opportunity.

## Scene 2 — Professor Greaves (Ravensreach Heights) (65–75 min) — PRIMARY INTEREST
Beats
- Entry method: Social (CHA pool) or forged invite (DEX/Deception pool).  
  - Required: 1S = brief access / 2S = private study access. Fail (0S): Greaves seals papers and requests time; party loses 10 minutes and must use another approach.

- Study search (INT + SENSE pool): Required successes: 1S = scraps of map; 2S = full fragment; 3S = hidden compartment with disposal letter naming an auction or courier. Fail: trigger a noisy bookshelf collapse (1 Con to nearest active player for dust/smoke) and a housekeeper suspicion (guard round in 5 minutes).

- Bargain / Protect Greaves (CHA pool): convincing Greaves to cooperate. Required: 2S for map sharing + safe wording on how to use info. Fail: Greaves retracts and asks for payment (50G) OR insists on anonymity — requires extra resource to reopen.

Scene opportunities (player goals as beats)
- Gaius: on INT/SENSE 1S, he notices a classical symbol matching legion symbology — tie to organized labor. Present this to the group to push political leverage.  
- Billy: if he notices shipping manifests (SENSE/DEX 1S), he finds a crate route (physical lead) that ties to Captain Silas Dorne.  
- Ronald: with 1S on an INT pool, he correlates the forged invoice to a Parliamentary aide and can name an MP to approach (group tool).  
- Tempii: can pick Marian's pocket (DEX 1S) for a cabinet key or a gossip slip; bringing it to the group converts that to 2S usable intel.  
- Jericho: stage a diversion in the servant wing (CHA 1S) to give the team time to search.  
- Herbert: examine the map margins—INT 1S detects rad-residue; 2S identifies a pattern that matches the "NINTH BELL" annotation and grants +1D to the map-decode check.

Context-aware DM nudges / private notes
- Gaius: "Point out the strange stamp on the ledger — it will make the steward nervous and open a conversation."  
- Billy: "A shipping route code is half-hidden—if you bring it to the group, they can requisition help to tail it."  
- Ronald: "You can quietly tell the group 'I see the MP name' — they'll trust your read and follow your lead if you propose the next action."  
- Tempii: "A small theft here gives you a bargaining chip; trade it in-group for the steward's confession."  
- Jericho: "Your public bluster can distract a visiting aide—use that to create a timed window for others to search."  
- Herbert: "That dust will light Greaves' eyes—show it and he'll volunteer the map link if you promise to keep him safe."

Scene Tablecraft tips
- If players bog down: offer a binary choice (Pay 50G to reacquire map vs. bluff with 2S Deception).  
- Keep Ronald and Tempii with DM nudges that explicitly tie private clues to an immediate group benefit.  
- Allow Herbert to trade arcane insight for an in-game mechanical bonus (+1D) to the map decode.

No-split mechanics (scene-specific)
- Time pressure: Greaves can only vouch for you for a limited window (countdown: 15 minutes). Solo attempts after window cost 1 Con and reduce the chance to retrieve map by -1S.  
- Dual-skill lock: Greaves' safe requires two different skills to open (e.g., DEX + INT), so someone must stay to assist.

Complications (scene)
- Parliamentary aide arrives unexpectedly — timed hide-or-parley task; failure = papers confiscated and a guard added.  
- Greaves' fear sells map fragment to a fence if spooked (leads to a short chase to recover it).

If players decide to stop here and push Plan directly
- If the group secures map + ledger fragment, they may approach a friendly MP with both pieces; use the combined evidence to request a meeting rather than proceed to Pine Wharf.

## Scene 3 — Ravensreach Manor / Pine Wharf Intercept (40–50 min, reduce if Scene 2 dominated)
Beats
- Gossip sweep / social probe: CHA pool. 1S = steward name; 2S = access to servant ledger with receipts. Fail: steward shuts down and files complaint (time lost, +1 patrol).  

- Approach choice (mechanic): Stealth (AGL pool, 2S for clean theft), Social (CHA pool, 2S to bribe/convince steward), Intercept (AGL+SENSE combined challenge: total 3S across players within allotted time). Fail: courier escapes but drops a bank receipt (partial lead) or party suffers 1 Con from scuffle.

- Resolution: if party gets trunk or ledger, they gain corroborating evidence. If only bank receipt recovered, it's still usable to push MP option.

Scene opportunities (player goals)
- Gaius: pair with another player to open a locker (STR/DEX +1S) and reveal a foreman's note.  
- Billy: use a shipping code to identify the dock time and team up to tail the crate (requires 2 players to lift and open).  
- Ronald: use forged invoice detail to bluff entry—1S gives a steward confession under pressure.  
- Tempii: sneak a valet's ring and barter it in-group for an auction lead.  
- Jericho: lead the diversion that forces guards to reposition (+1 advantage on stealth checks).  
- Herbert: analyze a recovered receipt for rad-residue—1S links it to Greaves' map.

Context-aware DM nudges / private notes
- Gaius: "You can brute the locker if someone steadies it—ask the group for help."  
- Billy: "The crate is heavy—if you call for assistance the team can open it quickly."  
- Ronald: "Your accusation works best if applied with the map in hand—propose the combo to the group."  
- Tempii: "That ring will buy you silence; trade it in-group for the auction name."  
- Jericho: "A loud distraction will split attention—coordinate the timing with the stealth team."  
- Herbert: "If you point out the residue pattern it will link the receipt to Greaves' tunnels."

Scene Tablecraft tips
- Use combined challenges: require multiple players' different stats within a time window to succeed, which forces them to stay and cooperate.  
- If players look to split, remind them of the momentum mechanic and the shared reward for cooperative solves.  
- Offer a fast 'what happens next' summary every 10 minutes to keep pace.

No-split mechanics (scene-specific)
- Momentum token: solo ventures cost 1 Momentum; group actions grant 1 Momentum. Momentum grants +2 on the next shared roll.  
- Physical requirement: opening crates/lockers requires 2 distinct players' checks—can't be done solo.

Complications (scene)
- Courier escapes but drops bank receipt (Violet Bank acct 41‑C).  
- Manor guard confrontation: lose 1 Con and forced retreat if fight escalates.

---

## Combined Evidence & Decision Point (10 min)
- If the party has: ledger fragment + map fragment → they can request an MP meeting (social route).  
- If they have ledger fragment + bank receipt → they can prepare a covert approach (heist route) or pressure a bank clerk for evidence.  
- Failure to gather 2 corroborating items within timebox = Syndicate suspicion increases (raise alert level for next session).
