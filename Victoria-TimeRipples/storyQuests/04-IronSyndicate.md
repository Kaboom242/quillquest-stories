# The Overthrow of the Iron Syndicate

## Summary / Objective
Remove the "Five Fingers" leadership and take control of Duke Garrick’s Iron Syndicate (or dismantle it). Primary targets are Bastien Crowl and his network of fronts and accountants.

### Complications
- Factory revolts and labor unrest may erupt if the Syndicate’s control is weakened.
- Rival gangs will move to exploit any power vacuum.
- The Syndicate uses legal fronts and deep social influence; evidence is tightly controlled.

## Hooks & Intel
- The Black Letter: Found at the ruined chapel bell tower in Ebonford Cross (overlooking Ashgrove). The victim sits upright in a chair, hands folded over a prayerbook, withered violets in a circle. Mouth sewn shut; a ripped page stuffed inside. Twist: coded marginalia in the prayerbook. Leads to evidence of a hidden religious cult resisting the nobility.

- Letter From "Pinky": Meet at 11:00 at The Drapper Lounge. Contact: Fran Burk (informant). Payment promised: 50G. Renno signs off.

## Bastien Crowl — Business Fronts (key targets)

- The Gilded Loom — textile export house that moves funds and conceals contraband in bales.
- Crowl & Sable, Accountants of Record — legal money-shufflers handling Parliament stipends and smelter payrolls; invitation-only access.
- The Silver Wall Social Club — gambling den where bets double as bribes or blackmail.
- Three Keys Auction House — auctions "reclaimed" property, sometimes arcane items under false names.
