Scenes

Scene A — Greaves’ Study: The Royal Academy Link (15–25 min)
Scene context: After initial questioning, Greaves admits a colleague at the Royal Academy studies “temporal artifacts” on Parliament grants and that the colleague secretly coordinates with the Ninth Bell Order. Greaves is fearful—he trusts the party only to a point and is worried the colleague will alert supporters if he’s seen talking.




Environmental Setup

Dusty study, maps pinned to a board, a ledger with grant receipts half-hidden in a drawer. Greaves paces, keeps glancing at the window toward the Academy post.
NPCs: Professor Greaves (nervous, self-preserving), Marian the maid (watchful), a messenger runs occasional notes to the Academy.
Primary approach options

Persuade Greaves to fully name the colleague and hand over evidence
Why: Greaves wants safety; a convincing offer of protection or reciprocity can persuade him.
Check: CHA pool. 1S = Greaves gives a vague name/description; 2S = he relinquishes a grant receipt and a line in his notes; 3S = he gives full name, lab location, and offers to delay alerting contacts.
Fail (0S): Greaves panics and hides his notes; he begins messaging the Academy (triggers Alert timer).
Search the study discreetly for correspondence or grant receipts
Why: Physical evidence ties the colleague to Parliament funding and the Order.
Check: DEX + INT pool (single player or combined). 1S = finds partial receipt; 2S = finds letter with coded reference to “Ninth Bell”; 3S = finds explicit grant record linking Parliament committees and an Academy lab name.
Risk: If caught (0S), Greaves is devastated and raises the alarm (Academy alerted).
Offer an academic cover (pose as donors or collaborators) to get the colleague’s name and lab access
Why: Academics respond to plausible patronage; cover opens introductions.
Check: CHA + INT pool. 1S = invitation to a Salon; 2S = small private introduction; 3S = immediate escorted access to the lower labs for a short inspection.
Risk: forging patronage poorly (0S) flags party to Academy ushers.
Team contributions

Jericho (CHA): roleplay persuasion or secure a salon invite — increases CHA success tier.
Ronald (INT): recognize grant letter formats or decode bureaucratic shorthand — converts a 1S search into 2S.
Herbert (INT): inspect residue on ledger margins to identify institutional ink → +1D for proving document authenticity.
Tempii (DEX): pocket an outgoing messenger note → adds +1S to the search.
Gaius/Billy: observation/search tasks — small success credits for finding hidden compartments or ledgers.
Consequences & complications

If Greaves is pushed or searched and a 0S occurs, he will send a discrete message to his colleague (start a 15–30 min “Academy Alert” timer).
Evidence obtained increases credibility for later Academy interactions; lack of evidence forces social approaches or riskier infiltration.
Logical next steps

With the colleague name/lab: plan a low-profile Academy approach (Scene B).
Without hard evidence: consider surveillance or a salon invite to observe the colleague publicly.
If Alert timer started: expect Academy security and Ninth Bell contacts to be on higher guard at the Silver Club.
Scene B — Royal Academy: Salon & Lecture (25–35 min)
Scene context: The colleague (Professor Lucien Harrow — pick name) gives a public lecture this week. It’s a chance to observe, bait, or socially infiltrate. The colleague is cautious and has discreet Order sympathizers within the Academy.

Environmental setup

Marble lecture hall and adjoining gallery where donors and patrons gather. Ushers and junior fellows circulate. Harrow sits with a small retinue and subtle guards. Conversations include references to grants, auctions, and “preservation.”
NPCs: Professor Harrow (polished, cagey), an Academy Steward (formal, will report disturbances), two junior fellows (gossips).
Primary approach options

Social infiltration (forged invite / donor cover)
Why: Salon culture grants proximity; a plausible donor or academic curiosity gains access.
Check: CHA + DEX (for convincing papers). 1S = allowed into gallery; 2S = brief private question after lecture; 3S = escorted to Harrow’s retinue for closer observation.
Risk: false credentials cause Steward to detain players and send word to Harrow (0S triggers immediate Alert).
Public confrontation under plausible pretext (ask a pointed question during Q&A)
Why: A public call-out may reveal Harrow’s guarded reaction, forcing him to slip or reveal alliances.
Check: CHA pool. 1S = Harrow deflects; 2S = he makes a revealing flinch or a telling phrase; 3S = he angrily leaves or sends a retainer to investigate the questioner.
Risk: Harrow signals guards; party becomes persona non grata and Academy security steps up.
Surveillance and discreet tailing after the lecture
Why: Following Harrow or his retinue can reveal lab routes, private meetings, or the Academy lab address.
Check: SENSE + AGL pool (team). Combined 3S across players in 10 minutes to follow without being seen. 1–2S = partial trail; 3S = lead to a side entrance/lab.
Risk: If trailed unsuccessfully (0S), a retainer spots tails and alerts Harrow.
Team contributions

Tempii (DEX): pickpocket a fellows’ card or a small note → +1S to surveillance or social infiltration.
Ronald (INT): ask the right academic questions to push Harrow’s guard — helps upgrade CHA outcomes.
Jericho (CHA): create a diversion to let tailers slip into service corridors.
Herbert (INT): mention theoretical artifact uses in the right moment to bait Harrow into reaction.
Consequences & complications

Success reveals lab entrance or a schedule of private transfers (useful for linking Harrow to Parliament shipments).
Failure or being recognized by Harrow increases the Academy Alert level and causes Harrow to quietly contact Parliament contacts or Order sympathizers (escalates to higher security at public locations such as the Silver Club).
Logical next steps

If lab info found: prepare an Academy archive/lab approach (Scene C) or timeline an infiltration timed for when Harrow is distracted.
If Harrow becomes hostile: consider slowing down, gather more corroboration, or execute a deniable option (stakeout instead of confrontation).
Scene C — Academy Archives / Lower Labs (30–40 min)
Scene context: A covert look at grant ledgers, shipping manifests, and private lab notes can confirm Parliament funding and Order links. This is high value but high risk.

Environmental setup

Underground archive room or service corridors below the Academy, locked, with a single steward-librarian and a late-night lab assistant who signs for packages. Low light, filing cabinets, and secure boxes with wax seals.
Primary approach options

Formal research request (patron letter or Greaves escort)
Why: A formal request reduces immediate suspicion and grants supervised access to some records.
Check: CHA + INT. 1S = limited supervised access; 2S = steward allows specific boxes; 3S = unsupervised glance at grant receipts and a lab ledger.
Risk: supervised access means less chance to copy sensitive lines (low physical evidence).
Stealth entry to archives (nightwork)
Why: Unsanctioned access gets unfiltered records but requires stealth.
Check: DEX + AGL (team). Combined 3S in 10 minutes for quiet entry and targeted search. 1–2S = find partial records; 3S = obtain grant receipts and a signed correspondence linking Parliament committee to Harrow and a “preservation” courier.
Risk: Alarm or steward discovery (0S) → Academy Alert, guards, and possible police involvement.
Bribe or persuade the lab assistant / librarian to hand over a copy or allow a private look
Why: Lowers immediate risk and creates an insider contact.
Check: CHA + resource. 1S = assistant hints at box location; 2S = they hand over a single page copy; 3S = ongoing contact willing to smuggle a copy later.
Risk: double-agent possibility; assistant may be an Order sympathizer.
Team contributions

Ronald (INT): quickly index useful file names and recognize parliamentary seals.
Jericho (CHA): negotiate or distract the librarian while others search.
Tempii (DEX): slip a small sealed package into a bag to smuggle out (1S mechanic).
Herbert (INT): check paper age and ink composition to verify grant authenticity (+1D to evidence credibility).
Consequences & complications

Concrete evidence (signed grant + courier name + lab references) is a major win: it links Harrow to Parliament and the Ninth Bell. This opens options to publicly expose or leverage politicians — both high-risk.
If discovery triggers Alert: Academy sends discreet inquiries to Parliament and private security; Harrow will be warned and likely avoid public sites like the Silver Club, or increase his security detail there.
Moral and strategic considerations (GM guidance)

Exposing Harrow publicly risks immediate retaliation and a political crackdown. Advise players that discreet, evidence-backed moves give more options than incendiary accusations.
If players are reported, escalate security at their next target (Silver Club) and add detection mechanics (guest lists, body searches, named watchlists).
Short GM nudges & timers

If Greaves or the Academy is spooked, start a 30–60 minute in-game escalation clock; expect increased guards at public venues and faster courier rotations.
Reward cooperative play: combine social + search successes to upgrade outcomes (e.g., a CHA success plus a DEX find = automatic 2S).
Suggested NPC names & short motives

Professor Lucien Harrow (Royal Academy): polished, politically connected, secretly sympathetic to the Ninth Bell’s goals because of promised funding and prestige. Suspicious of outsiders; will quietly alert allies if threatened.
Academy Steward Marlow: rigid, follows procedure; will report suspicious activity on a single warning.
Lab assistant Nia Black: overworked and bribable; may become a long-term contact.
Outcome mapping (quick)

Hard evidence obtained → players can plan a direct exposure, political leverage, or a timed infiltration at Silver Club with knowledge of Harrow’s movements.
Partial info only → require surveillance at Silver Club, social infiltration, or arrange Greaves’ protection to coax more info.
Alert triggered → higher security, potential traps at public events, reduced chance of close-access options.
Completion

Use these scenes to give the party multiple logical paths to learn Harrow’s role, and to force tradeoffs between speed (risk alert) and caution (gather more evidence). If you want, I can convert these scenes into the exact Markdown structure used in your session template and add Discord-ready handouts (excerpted grant receipts, lecture invitations, or a lab transfer manifest).



They also learn from Sir Alton Wexley that Friday Night at 10pm Silver Club in Stone Crown in 2 Days, 
Liao Shi: rich merchant of the Eastern silk trade will be attending a Gambiling socializing night and Thier Target Bastion Crowl is almost certainly going to be there.  They just need a way in. It will have heavy security. So they plan to sneak in with some Silk Creates from Liao Shi's Boat.  

Herbert Combs thinks they should stuff some "Dead bodies in the Creates and he can Reanimated them at the Silver Wall Social Club causing chaos and allowing the group to Kill bastion.  The Group will also need to get some bodies, maybe thier contacts at the Theieves guild can hook them up, or they can "get" some on the boat before they package up the cargo.
